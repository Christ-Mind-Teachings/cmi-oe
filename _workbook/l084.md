<sup>1</sup> These are the ideas for today's review:

\[67\] Love created me like Itself.
{: .review-lesson}

<sup>2</sup> I am in the likeness of my Creator. I cannot suffer, I
cannot experience loss, and I cannot die. I am not a body. I would
recognize my reality today. I will worship no idols nor raise my own
self-concepts to replace my Self. I am in the likeness of my Creator.
Love created me like Itself.

<sup>3</sup> You might find these specific forms helpful in applying the
idea:

<sup>4</sup> *Let me not see an illusion of myself in this.*  As I look
on this, let me remember my Creator.  My Creator did not create this as
I see it.

\[68\] Love holds no grievances.
{: .review-lesson}

<sup>5</sup> Grievances are completely alien to love. Grievances attack
love and keep its light obscure. If I hold grievances I am attacking
love and therefore attacking my Self. My Self thus becomes alien to me.
I am determined not to attack my Self today, so that I can remember who
I am.

<sup>6</sup> These specific forms for applying this idea would be
helpful:

<sup>7</sup> *This is no justification for denying my Self.<br/> I will
not use this to attack love.<br/> Let this not tempt me to attack
myself*.
