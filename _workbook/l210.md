\[190\] I choose the joy of God instead of pain.

<sup>1</sup> *Pain is my own idea. It is not<br/> a thought of God, but
one I thought apart<br/> from Him and from His Will. His Will is
joy<br/> and only joy for His beloved Son.<br/> And that I choose
instead of what I made.*

I am not a body. I am free. For I am still as God created me.
