<sup>1</sup> Today we will review these ideas:

\[75\] The light has come.
{: .review-lesson}

<sup>2</sup> In choosing salvation rather than attack, I merely choose
to recognize what is already here. Salvation is a decision made already.
Attack and grievances are not there to choose. That is why I always
choose between truth and illusion, between what is there and what is
not. The light has come. I can but choose the light, for it has no
alternative. It has replaced the darkness, and the dark is gone.

<sup>3</sup> These would prove useful forms for specific applications of
this idea:

<sup>4</sup> *This cannot show me darkness, for the light has come.<br/>
The light in you is all that I would see, \[name\].<br/> I would see in
this only what is there*.

\[76\] I am under no laws but God's.

<sup>5</sup> Here is the perfect statement of my freedom. I am under no
laws but God's. I am constantly tempted to make up other laws and give
them power over me. I suffer only because of my belief in them. They
have no real effect on me at all. I am perfectly free of the effects of
all laws save God's. And His are the laws of freedom.

<sup>6</sup> For specific forms in applying this idea, these would be
useful:

<sup>7</sup> *My perception of this shows me I believe in laws which do
not exist.<br/> I see only the laws of God at work in this.<br/> Let me
allow God's laws to work in this and not my own*.
