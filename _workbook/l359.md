God's answer is some form of peace. All pain<br/>
Is healed; all misery replaced with joy.<br/>
All prison doors are opened. And all sin<br/>
Is understood as merely a mistake.

<sup>1</sup> *Father, today we will forgive Your world and let creation
be Your own. We have misunderstood all things. But we have not made
sinners of the holy Sons of God. What You created sinless so abides
forever and forever. Such are we. And we rejoice to learn that we have
made mistakes which have no real effects on us. Sin is impossible, and
on this fact forgiveness rests upon a certain base more solid than the
shadow world we see. Help us forgive, for we would be redeemed. Help us
forgive, for we would be at peace.*
