### \[188\] The peace of God is shining in me now.

<sup>1</sup> *I will be still and let the earth be still<br/>
along with me. And in that stillness, we<br/>
will find the peace of God. It is within<br/>
my heart, which witnesses to God Himself.*

I am not a body. I am free. For I am still as God created me.
