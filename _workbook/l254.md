Let every voice but God's be still in me.
{: .lesson-header}

<sup>1</sup> *Father, today I would but hear Your Voice. In deepest
silence, I would come to You to hear Your Voice and to receive Your
Word. I have no prayer but this: I come to You to ask You for the truth.
And truth is but Your Will, which I would share with You today*.

<sup>2</sup> Today we let no ego thoughts direct our words or actions.
When such thoughts occur, we quietly step back and look at them, and
then we let them go. We do not want what they would bring with them. And
so we do not choose to keep them. They are silent now. And in the
stillness, hallowed by His Love, God speaks to us and tells us of our
will, as we have chosen to remember Him.
