Forgiveness is my function as the light of the world.
{: .lesson-header}

<sup>1</sup> It is your forgiveness that will bring the world of darkness to the
light. It is your forgiveness that lets you recognize the light in which
you see. Forgiveness is the demonstration that you are the light of the
world. Through your forgiveness does the truth about yourself return to
your memory. Therefore in your forgiveness lies your salvation.

<sup>2</sup> Illusions about yourself and the world are one. That is why all
forgiveness is a gift to yourself. Your goal is to find out who you are,
having denied your Identity by attacking creation and its Creator. Now
you are learning how to remember the truth. For this, attack must be
replaced by forgiveness so that thoughts of life may replace thoughts of
death.

<sup>3</sup> Remember that in every attack you call upon your own weakness, while
every time you forgive you call upon the strength of Christ in you. Do
you not then begin to understand what forgiveness will do for you? It
will remove all sense of weakness, strain, and fatigue from your mind.
It will take away all fear and guilt and pain. It will restore the
invulnerability and power God gave His Son to your awareness.

<sup>4</sup> Let us be glad to begin and end this day by practicing today's idea
and to use it as frequently as possible throughout the day. It will help
to make the day as happy for you as God wants you to be. And it will
help those around you as well as those who seem to be far away in space
and time to share this happiness with you.

<sup>5</sup> As often as you can, closing your eyes if possible, say to yourself:

<sup>6</sup> *Forgiveness is my function as the light of the world.*  *I would
fulfill my function that I may be happy.*

<sup>7</sup> Then devote a minute or two to considering your function and the
happiness and release it will bring you.

<sup>8</sup> Let related thoughts come freely, for your heart will recognize these
words, and in your mind is the awareness that they are true. Should your
attention wander, repeat the idea and add:

<sup>9</sup> *I would remember this because I want to be happy.*
