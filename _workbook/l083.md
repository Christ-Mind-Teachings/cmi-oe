<sup>1</sup> Today let us review these ideas:

\[65\] My only function is the one God gave me.
{: .review-lesson}

<sup>2</sup> I have no function but the one God gave me. This
recognition releases me from all conflict because it means I cannot have
conflicting goals. With one purpose only, I am always certain what to
do, what to say, and what to think. All doubt must disappear as I
acknowledge that my only function is the one God gave me.

<sup>3</sup> More specific applications of this idea might take these
forms:

<sup>4</sup> *My perception of this does not change my function.<br/>
This does not give me a function other than the one God gave me.<br/>
Let me not use this to justify a function God did not give me*.

\[66\] My happiness and my function are one.

<sup>5</sup> All things that come from God are one. They come from
Oneness and must be received as one. Fulfilling my function is my
happiness because both come from the same Source. And I must learn to
recognize what makes me happy if I would find happiness.

<sup>6</sup> Some useful forms for specific applications of this idea
are:

<sup>7</sup> *This cannot separate my happiness from my function.<br/>
The oneness of my happiness and my function<br/> remains wholly
unaffected by this.<br/> Nothing, including this, can justify the
illusion of happiness<br/> apart from my function*.
