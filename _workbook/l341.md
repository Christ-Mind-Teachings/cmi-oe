I can attack but my own sinlessness,<br/>
And it is only that which keeps me safe.

<sup>1</sup> *Father, Your Son is holy. I am he on whom You smile in
love and tenderness so deep and dear and still the universe smiles back
on You and shares Your holiness. How pure, how safe, how sacred then are
we, abiding in Your smile, with all Your Love bestowed upon us, living
one with You in brotherhood and Fatherhood complete, in sinlessness so
perfect that the Lord of Sinlessness conceives us as His Son, a universe
of thought completing Him.*

<sup>2</sup> Let us not then attack our sinlessness. For it contains the
Word of God to us, and in its kind reflection we are saved.
