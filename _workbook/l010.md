My thoughts do not mean anything.
{: .lesson-header}

<sup>1</sup> This idea applies to all the thoughts of which you are aware or become
aware in the practice periods. The reason the idea is applicable to all
of them is that they are not your real thoughts. We have made this
distinction before and will again. You have no basis for comparison as
yet. When you do, you will have no doubt that what you once believed
were your thoughts did not mean anything.

<sup>2</sup> This is the second time we have used this kind of idea. The form is
only slightly different. This time the idea is introduced with “My
thoughts” instead of “These thoughts” and no link is made overtly with
the things around you. The emphasis is now on the lack of reality of
what you think you think.

<sup>3</sup> This aspect of the correction process began with the idea that the
thoughts of which you are aware are meaningless, outside rather than
within, and then stressed their past rather than their present status.
Now we are emphasizing that the presence of these “thoughts” means that
you are not thinking. This is merely another way of repeating our
earlier statement that your mind is really a blank. To recognize this is
to recognize nothingness when you think you see it. As such, it is the
prerequisite for vision.

<sup>4</sup> Close your eyes for these exercises and introduce them by repeating
the idea for today quite slowly to yourself. Then add:

<sup>5</sup> *This idea will help to release me from all that I now believe*.

<sup>6</sup> The exercises consist, as before, in searching your mind for all the
thoughts which are available to you, without selection or judgment. Try
to avoid classification of any kind. In fact, if you find it helpful to
do so, you might imagine that you are watching an oddly assorted
procession going by, which has little if any personal meaning to you. As
each one crosses your mind, say:

<sup>7</sup> *This thought about \_\_\_\_\_ does not mean anything.<br/>
That thought about \_\_\_\_\_ does not mean anything*.

<sup>8</sup> Today's idea can obviously serve for any thought that distresses you
at any time. In addition, five practice periods are recommended, each
involving no more than a minute or so of mind searching. It is not
recommended that this time period be extended, and it should be reduced
to half a minute or even less if you experience discomfort. Remember,
however, to repeat the idea slowly before applying it specifically, and
also to add:

<sup>9</sup> *This idea will help to release me from all that I now believe*.
