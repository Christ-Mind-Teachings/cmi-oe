My holiness shines bright and clear today.
{: .lesson-header}

<sup>1</sup> Today I wake with joy, expecting but the happy things of
God to come to me. I ask but them to come and realize my invitation will
be answered by the thoughts to which they have been sent by me. And I
will ask for only joyous things the instant I accept my holiness. For
what would be the use of pain to me, what purpose would my suffering
fulfill, and how would grief and loss avail me, if insanity departs from
me today and I accept my holiness instead?

<sup>2</sup> *Father, my holiness is Yours. Let me rejoice in it and
through forgiveness be restored to sanity. Your Son is still as You
created him. My holiness is part of me and also part of You. And what
can alter Holiness Itself?*
