Truth answers every call we make to God,<br/>
Responding first with miracles, and then<br/>
Returning unto us to be itself.

<sup>1</sup> *Forgiveness, truth's reflection, tells me how to offer
miracles and thus escape the prison house in which I think I live. Your
holy Son is pointed out to me, first in my brother, then in me. Your
Voice instructs me patiently to hear Your Word and give as I receive.
And as I look upon Your Son today, I hear Your Voice instructing me to
find the way to You as You appointed that the way shall be: “Behold his
sinlessness, and be you healed.”*
