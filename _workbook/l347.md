Anger must come from judgment. Judgment is<br/>
The weapon I would use against myself<br/>
To keep all miracles away from me.

<sup>1</sup> *Father, I want what goes against my will and do not want
what is my will to have. Straighten my mind, my Father. It is sick. But
You have offered freedom, and I choose to claim Your gift today. And so
I give all judgment to the One You gave to me to judge for me. He sees
what I behold, and yet He knows the truth. He looks on pain, and yet He
understands it is not real, and in His understanding it is healed. He
gives the miracles my dreams would hide from my awareness. Let Him judge
today. I do not know my will, but He is sure it is Your own. And He will
speak for me, and call Your miracle to come to me.*

<sup>2</sup> Listen today. Be very still and hear the gentle Voice for
God assuring you that He has judged you as the Son He loves.
