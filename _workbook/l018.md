<sup>1</sup> The idea for today is another step in learning that the thoughts which
give rise to what you see are never neutral or unimportant. It also
emphasizes the idea that minds are joined, which will be given
increasing stress later.

<sup>2</sup> Today's idea does not refer to what you see as much as to how you see
it. Therefore, the exercises for today will emphasize this aspect of
your perception. The three or four practice periods which are
recommended should be done as follows:

<sup>3</sup> Selecting subjects for the application of the idea randomly, look at
each one long enough to say:

<sup>4</sup> *I am not alone in experiencing the effects of how I see \_\_\_\_\_*.

<sup>5</sup> Conclude the practice period by repeating the more general statement:

<sup>6</sup> *I am not alone in experiencing the effects of my seeing*.

<sup>7</sup> A minute or so or even less will be sufficient.
