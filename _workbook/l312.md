I see all things as I would have them be.
{: .lesson-header}

<sup>1</sup> Perception follows judgment. Having judged, you therefore
see what you would look upon. For vision merely serves to offer you what
you would have. It is impossible to overlook what you would see and fail
to see what you have chosen to behold. How surely, therefore, must the
real world come to greet the holy sight of anyone who takes the Holy
Spirit's purpose as his goal for seeing. And he cannot fail to look upon
what Christ would have him see and share Christ's love for what he looks
upon.

<sup>2</sup> *I have no purpose for today except to look upon a
liberated world, set free from all the judgments I have made. Father,
this is Your will for me today, and therefore it must be my goal as
well.*
