Judgment and love are opposites. From one<br/>
Come all the sorrows of the world. But from<br/>
The other comes the peace of God Himself.

<sup>1</sup> *Forgiveness looks on sinlessness alone and judges not.
Through this I come to You. Judgment will bind my eyes and make me
blind. Yet love, reflected in forgiveness here, reminds me You have
given me a way to find Your peace again. I am redeemed when I elect to
follow in this way. You have not left me comfortless. I have within me
both the memory of You and One Who leads me to it. Father, I would hear
Your Voice and find Your peace today. For I would love my own Identity
and find in Him the memory of You.*
