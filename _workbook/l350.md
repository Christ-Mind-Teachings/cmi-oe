Miracles mirror God's eternal Love.<br/>
To offer them is to remember Him,<br/>
And through His memory to save the world.

<sup>1</sup> *What we forgive becomes a part of us as we perceive
ourselves. The Son of God incorporates all things within himself as You
created him. Your memory depends on his forgiveness. What he is, is
unaffected by his thoughts. But what he looks upon is their direct
result. Therefore, my Father, I would turn to You. Only Your memory will
set me free. And only my forgiveness teaches me to let Your memory
return to me and give it to the world in thankfulness.*

<sup>2</sup> And as we gather miracles from Him, we will indeed be
grateful. For as we remember Him, His Son will be restored to us in the
Reality of Love.
