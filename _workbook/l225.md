God is my Father, and His Son loves Him.
{: .lesson-header}

<sup>1</sup> *Father, I must return Your love for me. For giving and
receiving are the same, and You have given all Your love to me. I must
return it, for I want it mine in full awareness, blazing in my mind, and
keeping it within its kindly light, inviolateâ€”beloved, with fear behind
and only peace ahead. How still the way Your loving Son is led along to
You!*

<sup>2</sup> Brother, we find that stillness now. The way is open. Now
we follow it in peace together. You have reached your hand to me, and I
will never leave you. We are one, and it is but this oneness that we
seek as we accomplish these few final steps which end a journey that was
not begun.
