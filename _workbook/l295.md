The Holy Spirit looks through me today.
{: .lesson-header}

<sup>1</sup> Christ asks that He may use my eyes today and thus redeem
the world. He asks this gift that He may offer peace of mind to me and
take away all terror and all pain. And as they are removed from me, the
dreams that seemed to settle on the world are gone. Redemption must be
one. As I am saved, the world is saved with me. For all of us must be
redeemed together. Fear appears in many different forms, but love is
one.

<sup>2</sup> *My Father, Christ has asked a gift of me, and one I give
that it be given me. Help me to use the eyes of Christ today and thus
allow the Holy Spirit's love to bless all things that I may look upon,
that His forgiving love may rest on me.*
