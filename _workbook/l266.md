My holy Self abides in you, God's Son.
{: .lesson-header}

<sup>1</sup> *Father, You gave me all Your Sons to be my saviors and my
counselors in sight—the bearers of Your holy Voice to me. In them are
You reflected, and in them does Christ look back upon me from my Self.
Let not Your Son forget Your holy Name. Let not Your Son forget his holy
Source. Let not Your Son forget Your name is his.*

<sup>2</sup> This day we enter into paradise, calling upon God's name
and on our own, acknowledging our Self in each of us, united in the holy
Love of God. How many saviors God has given us! How can we lose the way
to Him, when He has filled the world with those who point to Him and
given us the sight to look on them?
