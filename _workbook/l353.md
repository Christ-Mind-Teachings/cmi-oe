My eyes, my tongue, my hands, my feet today<br/>
Have but one purposeâ€”to be given Christ<br/>
To use to bless the world with miracles.

<sup>1</sup> *Father, I give all that is mine today to Christ to use in
any way that best will serve the purpose that I share with Him. Nothing
is mine alone, for He and I have joined in purpose. Thus has learning
come almost to its appointed end. A while I work with Him to serve His
purpose. Then I lose myself in my Identity and recognize that Christ is
but my Self.*
