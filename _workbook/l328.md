I choose the second place to gain the first.
{: .lesson-header}

<sup>1</sup> What seems to be the second place is first, for all things
we perceive are upside-down until we listen to the Voice of God. It
seems that we will gain autonomy but by our striving to be separate and
that our independence from the rest of God's creation is the way in
which salvation is obtained. Yet all we find is sickness, suffering and
loss, and death. This is not what our Father wills for us, nor is there
any second to His Will. To join with His is but to find our own. And
since our will is His, it is to Him that we must go to recognize our
will.

<sup>2</sup> *There is no will but Yours. And I am glad that nothing I
imagine contradicts what You would have me be. It is Your will that I be
wholly safe, eternally at peace. And happily I share that will which
You, my Father, gave as part of me.*
