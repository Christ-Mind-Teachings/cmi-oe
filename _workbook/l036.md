My holiness envelops everything I see.
{: .lesson-header}

<sup>1</sup> Today's idea extends the idea for yesterday from the perceiver to the
perceived. You are holy because your mind is part of God's. And because
you are holy, your sight must be holy as well. “Sinless” means without
sin. You cannot be without sin a little. You are sinless or not. If your
mind is part of God's, you must be sinless or a part of His Mind would
be sinful. Your sight is related to His holiness, not to your ego and
therefore not to your body.

<sup>2</sup> Four three- to five-minute practice periods are required for today.
Try to distribute them fairly evenly, and make the shorter applications
frequently to protect your protection throughout the day. The longer
practice periods should take this form:

<sup>3</sup> First, close your eyes and repeat the idea for today several times
slowly. Then open your eyes and look quite slowly about you, applying
the idea specifically to whatever you note in your casual survey. Say,
for example:

<sup>4</sup> *My holiness envelops that rug.<br/>
My holiness envelops that wall.<br/>
My holiness envelops these fingers.<br/>
My holiness envelops that chair.<br/>
My holiness envelops that body.<br/>
My holiness envelops this pen*.

<sup>5</sup> Several times during these practice periods, close your eyes and
repeat the idea to yourself. Then open your eyes and continue as before.

<sup>6</sup> For the shorter exercise periods, close your eyes and repeat the idea;
look about you as you repeat it again; and conclude with one more
repetition with your eyes closed. All applications should, of course, be
made quite slowly, as effortlessly and unhurriedly as possible.
