I have already chosen what You will.
{: .lesson-header}

<sup>1</sup> *Father, I thought I wandered from Your Will, defied it,
broke its laws, and interposed a second will more powerful than Yours.
Yet what I am in truth is but Your Will, extended and extending. This am
I. And this will never change. As You are One, so am I one with You. And
this I chose in my creation, where my will became forever one with
Yours. That choice was made for all eternity. It cannot change and be in
opposition to itself. Father, my will is Yours. And I am safe,
untroubled and serene in endless joy because it is Your will that it be
so.*

<sup>2</sup> Today we will accept our union with each other and our
Source. We have no will apart from His, and all of us are one because
His Will is shared by all of us. Through it we recognize that we are
one. Through it we find our way at last to God.
