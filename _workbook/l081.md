title: Review Lessons 61 - 62
ref: "81"
---

<sup>1</sup> Our ideas for review today are:

\[61\] I am the light of the world.
{: .review-lesson}

<sup>2</sup> How holy am I, who have been given the function of lighting
up the world! Let me be still before my holiness. In its calm light, let
all my conflicts disappear. In its peace, let me remember who I am.

<sup>3</sup> Some specific forms for applying today's idea when specific
difficulties seem to arise might be:

<sup>4</sup> *Let me not obscure the light of the world in me.<br/> Let
the light of the world shine through this appearance.<br/> This shadow
will vanish before the light*.

\[62\] Forgiveness is my function as the light of the world.
{: .review-lesson}

<sup>5</sup> It is through accepting my function that I will see the
light in me. And in this light will my function stand clear and
perfectly unambiguous before my sight. My acceptance does not depend on
my recognizing what my function is, for I do not yet understand
forgiveness. Yet I will trust that in the light I will see it as it is.

<sup>6</sup>Specific forms for using the idea might include:

<sup>7</sup> *Let this help me learn what forgiveness means.<br/> Let me
not separate my function from my will.<br/> I would not use this for an
alien purpose*.
