<sup>1</sup> *You Who remember what I really am alone remember what I
really want. You speak for God, and so You speak for me. And what You
give me comes from God Himself. Your Voice, my Father, then is mine as
well, and all I want is what You offer me, in just the form You chose
that it be mine. Let me remember all I do not know, and let my voice be
still, remembering. But let me not forget Your Love and care, keeping
Your promise to Your Son in my awareness always. Let me not forget
myself is nothing, but my Self is all.*
