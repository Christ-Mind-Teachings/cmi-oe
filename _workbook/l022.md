What I see is a form of vengeance.
{: .lesson-header}

<sup>1</sup> Today's idea accurately describes the way anyone who holds attack
thoughts in his mind must see the world. Having projected his anger onto
the world, he sees vengeance about to strike at him. His own attack is
thus perceived as self defense. This becomes an increasingly vicious
circle until he is willing to change how he sees. Otherwise, thoughts of
attack and counter-attack will preoccupy him and people his entire
world. What peace of mind is possible to him then?

<sup>2</sup> It is from this savage fantasy that you want to escape. Is it not
joyous news to hear that it is not real? Is it not a happy discovery to
find that you can escape? You made what you would destroyâ€”everything
that you hate and would attack and kill. All that you fear does not
exist.

<sup>3</sup> Look at the world about you at least five times today, for at least a
minute each time. As your eyes move slowly from one object to another,
from one body to another, say to yourself:

<sup>4</sup> *I see only the perishable.<br/>
I see nothing that will last.<br/>
What I see is not real.<br/>
What I see is a form of vengeance*.

<sup>5</sup> At the end of each practice period, ask yourself:

<sup>6</sup> *Is this the world I really want to see?*

<sup>7</sup> The answer is surely obvious.
