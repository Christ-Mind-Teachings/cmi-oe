God is the only goal I have today.
{: .lesson-header}

<sup>1</sup> The way to God is through forgiveness here. There is no
other way. If sin had not been cherished by the mind, what need would
there have been to find a way to where you are? Who would still be
uncertain? Who could be unsure of who he is? And who would yet remain
asleep in heavy clouds of doubt about the holiness of him whom God
created sinless? Here we can but dream. But we can dream we have
forgiven him in whom all sin remains impossible, and it is this we
choose to dream today. God is our goal; forgiveness is the means by
which our minds return to Him at last.

<sup>2</sup> *And so, our Father, would we come to You in Your appointed
way. We have no goal except to hear Your Voice and find the way Your
sacred Word has pointed out to us*.
