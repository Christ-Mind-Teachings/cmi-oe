Love, Which created me, is what I am.
{: .lesson-header}

<sup>1</sup> I seek my own Identity and find it in these words: “Love,
Which created me, is what I am.” Now need I seek no more. Love has
prevailed. So still it waited for my coming home that I will turn away
no longer from the holy face of Christ. And what I look upon attests the
truth of the Identity I sought to lose, but which my Father has kept
safe for me.

<sup>2</sup> *Father, my thanks to You for what I am; for keeping my
Identity untouched and sinless in the midst of all the thoughts of sin
my foolish mind made up. And thanks to You for saving me from them.
Amen.*
