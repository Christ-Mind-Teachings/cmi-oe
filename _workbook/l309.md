I will not fear to look within today.
{: .lesson-header}

<sup>1</sup> Within me is eternal innocence because it is God's Will
that it be there forever and forever. I, His Son, whose will is
limitless as is His own, can will no change in this. For to deny my
Father's Will is to deny my own. To look within is but to find my will
as God created it and as it is. I fear to look within because I think I
made another will which is not true and made it real. Yet it has no
effects. Within me is the holiness of God. Within me is the memory of
Him.

<sup>2</sup> *The step I take today, my Father, is my sure release from
idle dreams of sin. Your altar stands serene and undefiled. It is the
holy altar to my Self, and there I find my true Identity.*
