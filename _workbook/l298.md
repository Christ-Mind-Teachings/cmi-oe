I love You, Father, and I love Your Son.
{: .lesson-header}

<sup>1</sup> My gratitude permits my love to be accepted without fear.
And thus am I restored to my reality at last. All that intruded on my
holy sight forgiveness takes away. And I draw near the end of senseless
journeys, mad careers, and artificial values. I accept instead what God
establishes as mine, sure that in that alone I will be saved, sure that
I go through fear to meet my Love.

<sup>2</sup> *Father, I come to You today, because I would not follow
any way but Yours. You are beside me. Certain is Your way. And I am
grateful for Your holy gifts of certain sanctuary and escape from
everything that would obscure my love for God, my Father, and His holy
Son.*
