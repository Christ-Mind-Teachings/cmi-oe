## <em>A Course in Miracles</em> Original Edition!
{: .ui.header}

This edition of A Course in Miracles is referred to as the “Original
Edition“ and is the Course as it was completed in 1972 before
significant edits were made in 1975. It is essentially the manuscript
that was discovered in 1999 and published by Course in Miracles Society
in 2006.

Perhaps you may have only previously been aware of A Course in Miracles
as published by the Foundation for Inner Peace and then by some amazing
sequence of events you have discovered that there is actually an edition
that pre-dates the well-known blue book. The ACIM Original Edition,
published by Course in Miracles Society [CIMS], is that early edition.

Choose “Get Acquainted” to discover more about how this journey of A
Course in Miracles began, the path of its evolution, its various
formats, and how you can obtain a copy.
