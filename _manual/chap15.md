15\. Is Each One to be Judged in the End?
{: .lesson-header}

Indeed yes! No one can escape God's Final Judgment. Who could flee
forever from the truth? But the Final Judgment will not come until it is
no longer associated with fear. One day each one will welcome it, and on
that very day it will be given him. He will hear his sinlessness
proclaimed around and around the world, setting it free as God's Final
Judgment on him is received. This is the judgment in which salvation
lies. This is the judgment that will set him free. This is the judgment
in which all things are freed with him. Time pauses as eternity comes
near, and silence lies across the world that everyone may hear this
judgment of the Son of God:

<sup>2</sup> *Holy are you, eternal, free, and whole,<br/>
At peace forever in the Heart of God.<br/>
Where is the world and where is sorrow now?*

<sup>3</sup> Is this your judgment on yourself, teacher of God? Do you
believe that this is wholly true? No, not yet, not yet. But this is
still your goalâ€”why you are here. It is your function to prepare
yourself to hear this judgment and to recognize that it is true. One
instant of complete belief in this, and you will go beyond belief to
certainty. One instant out of time can bring time's end. Judge not, for
you but judge yourself and thus delay this Final Judgment. What is your
judgment on the world, teacher of God? Have you yet learned to stand
aside and hear the Voice of Judgment in yourself? Or do you still
attempt to take His role from Him? Learn to be quiet, for His Voice is
heard in stillness. And His Judgment comes to all who stand aside in
quiet listening and wait for Him.

<sup>4</sup> You who are sometimes sad and sometimes angry, who
sometimes feel your just due is not given you and your best efforts meet
with lack of appreciation and even contempt, give up these foolish
thoughts. They are too small and meaningless to occupy your holy minds
an instant longer. God's judgment waits for you to set you free. What
can the world hold out to you, regardless of your judgments on its
gifts, that you would rather have? You will be judged, and judged in
fairness and in honesty. There is no deceit in God. His promises are
sure. Only remember that. His promises have guaranteed that His
judgment, and His alone, will be accepted in the end. It is your
function to make that end be soon. It is your function to hold it to
your heart and offer it to all the world to keep it safe.
