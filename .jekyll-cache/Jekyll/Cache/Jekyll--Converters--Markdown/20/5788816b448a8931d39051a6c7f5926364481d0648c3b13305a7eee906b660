I"Ó<p><sup>30</sup> We have been emphasizing perception and have said very little about
cognition as yet, because you are confused about the difference between
them. The reason we have dealt so little with cognition is because you
must get your perceptions straightened out before you can <em>know</em> anything.
To know is to be certain. Uncertainty merely means that you do <em>not</em> know.
Knowledge is power <em>because</em> it is certain, and certainty is strength.
Perception is merely temporary. It is an attribute of the space-time
belief and is therefore subject to fear or love. Misperceptions produce
fear, and true perceptions produce love. <em>Neither</em> produces certainty,
because <em>all</em> perception varies. That is why it is <em>not</em> knowledge.</p>

<p><sup>31</sup> True perception is the <em>basis</em> for knowledge, but <em>knowing</em> is the
affirmation of truth. All your difficulties ultimately stem from the
fact that you do not recognize or <em>know</em> yourselves, each other, or God.
To recognize means to ‚Äúknow again,‚Äù implying that you knew before. You
can see in many ways, because perception involves different
interpretations, and this means that it is not whole. The miracle is a
way of perceiving, <em>not</em> of knowing. It is the right answer to a question,
and you do not ask questions at all when you know.</p>

<p><sup>32</sup> Questioning illusions is the first step in undoing them. The miracle,
or the ‚Äúright answer,‚Äù corrects them. Since perceptions <em>change</em>, their
dependence on time is obvious. They are subject to transitory states,
and this necessarily implies variability. How you perceive at any given
time determines what you <em>do</em>, and action <em>must</em> occur in time. Knowledge is
timeless, because certainty is <em>not</em> questionable. You <em>know</em> when you have
<em>ceased</em> to ask questions.</p>

<p><sup>33</sup> The questioning mind perceives itself in time and therefore looks for
<em>future</em> answers. The unquestioning mind is closed because it believes the
future and present will be the same. This establishes an unchanged state
or stasis. It is usually an attempt to counteract an underlying fear
that the future will be <em>worse</em> than the present, and this fear inhibits
the tendency to question at all.</p>

<p><sup>34</sup> Visions are the natural perception of the Spiritual eye, but they are
still corrections. The Spiritual eye is symbolic and therefore not a
device for knowing. It <em>is</em>, however, a means of right perception, which
brings it into the proper domain of the miracle. Properly speaking, ‚Äúa
vision of God‚Äù is a miracle rather than a revelation. The fact that
perception is involved at all removes the experience from the realm of
knowledge. That is why visions do not last.</p>

<p><sup>35</sup> The Bible instructs you to ‚Äú<em>know</em> yourself‚Äù or <em>be certain</em>. Certainty
is <em>always</em> of God. When you love someone, you have perceived him as he
is, and this makes it possible for you to <em>know</em> him. However, it is not
until you <em>recognize</em> him that you can know him. While you ask questions
about God, you are clearly implying that you do <em>not</em> know Him. Certainty
does not require action. When you say that you are <em>acting</em> on the basis
of knowledge, you are really confusing perception and cognition.
Knowledge brings the mental strength for creative <em>thinking</em> but <em>not</em> for
right <em>doing</em>. Perception, miracles, and doing are closely related.
Knowledge is the result of revelation and induces only thought.
Perception involves the body, even in its most spiritualized form.
Knowledge comes from the altar within and is timeless because it is
certain. To perceive the truth is <em>not</em> the same as knowing it.</p>

<p><sup>36</sup> If you attack error in one another, you will hurt yourself. You
cannot <em>recognize</em> each other when you attack. Attack is <em>always</em> made on a
stranger. You are <em>making</em> him a stranger by misperceiving him so that you
<em>cannot</em> know him. It is <em>because</em> you have made him a stranger that you are
afraid of him. <em>Perceive</em> him correctly so that you can <em>know</em> him. Right
perception is necessary before God can communicate directly to His own
altars which He has established in His Sons. There He can communicate
His certainty, and <em>His</em> knowledge will bring peace <em>without</em> question.</p>

<p><sup>37</sup> God is not a stranger to His Sons, and His Sons are not strangers to
each other. Knowledge preceded both perception and time and will
ultimately replace them. That is the real meaning of the Biblical
description of God as ‚ÄúAlpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End.‚Äù It
also explains the quotation, ‚ÄúBefore Abraham was <em>I am</em>.‚Äù Perception can
and must be stabilized, but knowledge <em>is</em> stable. ‚ÄúFear God and keep His
commandments‚Äù should read ‚Äú<em>Know</em> God and accept His certainty.‚Äù There are
no strangers in His creation. To create as He created, you can create
only what you <em>know</em> and accept as yours. God knows His Children with
perfect certainty. He created them <em>by</em> knowing them. He recognized them
perfectly. When they do not recognize each other, they do not recognize
Him.</p>
