I"a<p class="lesson-header">I can elect to change all thoughts that hurt.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Loss is not loss when properly perceived. Pain is
impossible. There is no grief with any cause at all. And suffering of
any kind is nothing but a dream. Such is the truthâ€”at first to be but
said and then repeated many times and next to be accepted as but partly
true with many reservations. Then to be considered seriously more and
more, and finally accepted as the truth. I can elect to change all
thoughts that hurt. And I would go beyond these words today, go past all
reservations, and arrive at full acceptance of the truth in them.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>Father, what You have given cannot hurt, and grief and
pain must be impossible. Let me not fail to trust in You today,
accepting but the joyous as Your gifts, accepting but the joyous as the
truth.</em></p>
