I"í<p class="lesson-header">You are my goal, my Father. Only You.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Where would I go but Heaven? What could be a substitute for
happiness? What gift could I prefer before the peace of God? What
treasure would I seek and find and keep that can compare with my
Identity? And would I rather live with fear than love?</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>You are my goal, my Father. What but You could I desire to
have? What way but that which leads to You could I desire to walk? And
what except the memory of You could signify to me the end of dreams and
futile substitutions for the truth? You are my only goal. Your Son would
be as You created him. What way but this could I expect to recognize my
Self and be at one with my Identity?</em></p>
