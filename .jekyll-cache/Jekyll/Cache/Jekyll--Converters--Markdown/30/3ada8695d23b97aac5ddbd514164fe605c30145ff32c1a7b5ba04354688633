<p><sup>1</sup> Let us today attend the Voice of God, Which speaks an
ancient lesson, no more true today than any other day. Yet has this day
been chosen as the time when we will seek and hear and learn and
understand. Join me in hearing. For the Voice of God tells us of things
we cannot understand alone, nor learn apart. It is in this that all
things are protected. And in this the healing of the Voice of God is
found.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>Your healing Voice protects all things today, and so I
leave all things to You. I need be anxious over nothing. For Your Voice
will tell me what to do and where to go, to whom to speak, and what to
say to him, what thoughts to think, what words to give the world. The
safety that I bring is given me. Father, Your Voice protects all things
through me.</em></p>
