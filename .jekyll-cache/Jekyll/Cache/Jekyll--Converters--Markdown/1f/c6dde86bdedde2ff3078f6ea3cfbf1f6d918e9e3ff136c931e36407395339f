I"¯<p>This is Palm Sunday, the celebration of victory and the acceptance of
the truth. Let us not spend this holy week brooding on the crucifixion
of Godâ€™s Son, but happily in the celebration of his release. For Easter
is the sign of peace, not pain. A slain Christ has no meaning. But a
<em>risen</em> Christ becomes the symbol of the Son of Godâ€™s forgiveness of
himself; the sign he looks upon himself as healed and whole.</p>
