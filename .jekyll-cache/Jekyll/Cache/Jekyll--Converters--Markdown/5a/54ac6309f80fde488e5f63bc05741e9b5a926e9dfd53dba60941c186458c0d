My sinful brother is my guide to pain.<br />
And which I choose to see I will behold.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <em>Who is my brother but Your holy Son? And if I see him
sinful, I proclaim myself a sinner, not a Son of God, alone and
friendless in a fearful world. Yet this perception is a choice I make
and can relinquish. I can also see my brother sinless as Your holy Son.
And with this choice I see my sinlessness, my everlasting Comforter and
Friend beside me, and my way secure and clear. Choose, then, for me, my
Father, through Your Voice. For He alone gives judgment in Your Name.</em></p>
