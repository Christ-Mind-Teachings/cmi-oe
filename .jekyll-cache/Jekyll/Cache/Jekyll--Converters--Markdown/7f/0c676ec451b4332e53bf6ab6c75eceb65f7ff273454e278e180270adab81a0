I"x<p class="lesson-header">I will receive whatever I request.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> No one desires pain. But he can think that pain is
pleasure. No one would avoid his happiness. But he can think that joy is
painful, threatening, and dangerous. Everyone will receive what he
requests. But he can be confused indeed about the things he wants, the
state he would attain. What can he then request that he would want when
he receives it? He has asked for what will frighten him and bring him
suffering. Let us resolve today to ask for what we really want, and only
this, that we may spend this day in fearlessness, without confusing pain
with joy or fear with love.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>Father, this is Your day. It is a day in which I would do
nothing by myself but hear Your Voice in everything I do; requesting
only what You offer me, accepting only thoughts You share with me.</em></p>
