I"<p>You have been told not to make error real, and the way to do this is
very simple. If you <em>want</em> to believe in error, you would <em>have</em> to make
it real because it is not true. But truth is real in its own right, and
to believe in truth, <em>you do not have to do anything</em>. Understand that
you do not respond to stimuli, but to stimuli <em>as you interpret them.</em>
Your interpretation thus becomes the justification for the response.
That is why analyzing the motives of others is hazardous to <em>you</em>. If
you decide that someone is really trying to attack you or desert you or
enslave you, you will respond <em>as if</em> he had actually done so, because
you have made his error <em>real</em> to you. To interpret error is to give it
power, and having done this, you <em>will</em> overlook truth.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> The analysis of ego-motivation is very complicated, very obscuring,
and <em>never</em> without the risk of your own ego-involvement. The whole
process represents a clear-cut attempt to demonstrate your <em>own</em> ability
to understand what you perceive. This is shown by the fact that you
react to your interpretations <em>as if</em> they were correct and control your
reactions behaviorally but not emotionally. This is quite evidently a
mental split in which you have attacked the integrity of your mind and
pitted one level within it against another.</p>
