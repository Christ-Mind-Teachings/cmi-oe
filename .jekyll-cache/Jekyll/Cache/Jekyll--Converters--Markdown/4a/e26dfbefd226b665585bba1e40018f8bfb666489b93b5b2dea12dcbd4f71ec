I"L<p><sup>1</sup> These are our review ideas for today:</p>

<p class="review-lesson">[77] I am entitled to miracles.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> I am entitled to miracles because I am under no laws but
God’s. His laws release me from all grievances and replace them with
miracles. And I would accept the miracles in place of the grievances,
which are but illusions that hide the miracles beyond. Now I would
accept only what the laws of God entitle me to have that I may use it on
behalf of the function He has given me.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> You might use these suggestions for specific applications
of this idea:</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> <em>Behind this is a miracle to which I am entitled.<br /> Let
me not hold a grievance against you [name],<br /> but offer you the
miracle that belongs to you instead.<br /> Seen truly, this offers me a
miracle</em>.</p>

<p class="review-lesson">[78] Let miracles replace all grievances.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> By this idea do I unite my will with the Holy Spirit’s and
perceive them as one. By this idea do I accept my release from hell. By
this idea do I express my willingness to have all my illusions be
replaced with truth according to God’s plan for my salvation. I would
make no exceptions and no substitutes. I want all of Heaven and only
Heaven, as God wills me to have.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup> Useful specific forms for applying this idea would be:</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> <em>I would not hold this grievance apart from my
salvation.<br /> Let our grievances be replaced by miracles,
[name].<br /> Beyond this is the miracle by which all my grievances are
replaced</em>.</p>
