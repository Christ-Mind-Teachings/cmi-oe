I"½<p class="lesson-header">I rule my mind, which I alone must rule.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> I have a kingdom I must rule. At times, it does not seem I
am its king at all. It seems to triumph over me and tell me what to
think and what to do and feel. And yet it has been given me to serve
whatever purpose I perceive in it. My mind can only serve. Today I give
its service to the Holy Spirit to employ as He sees fit. I thus direct
my mind, which I alone can rule. And thus I set it free to do the Will
of God.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>Father, my mind is open to Your thoughts and closed today
to every thought but Yours. I rule my mind and offer it to You. Accept
my gift, for it is Yours to me</em>.</p>
