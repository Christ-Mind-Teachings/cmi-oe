I"³<p class="lesson-header">Today I will judge nothing that occurs.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> I will be honest with myself today. I will not think that I
already know what must remain beyond my present grasp. I will not think
I understand the whole from bits of my perception, which are all that I
can see. Today I recognize that this is so. And so I am relieved of
judgment which I cannot make. Thus do I free myself and what I look
upon, to be in peace as God created us.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>Father, today I leave creation free to be itself. I honor
all its parts, in which I am included. We are one because each part
contains Your memory, and truth must shine in all of us as one.</em></p>
