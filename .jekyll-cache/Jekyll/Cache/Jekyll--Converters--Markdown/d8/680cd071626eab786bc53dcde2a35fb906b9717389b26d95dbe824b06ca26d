<p><sup>1</sup> <em>Father, the truth belongs to me. My home is set in Heaven
by Your will and mine. Can dreams content me? Can illusions bring me
happiness? What but Your memory can satisfy Your Son? I will accept no
less than You have given me. I am surrounded by Your Love, forever
still, forever gentle, and forever safe. Godâ€™s Son must be as You
created him.</em></p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Today we pass illusions by. And if we hear temptation call
to us to stay and linger in a dream, we turn aside and ask ourselves if
we, the Sons of God, could be content with dreams when Heaven can be
chosen just as easily as hell and love will happily replace all fear.</p>
