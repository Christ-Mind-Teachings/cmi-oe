I" <p><sup>1</sup> Our review today will cover these ideas:</p>

<p class="review-lesson">[73] I will there be light.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> I will use the power of my will today. It is not my will to
grope about in darkness, fearful of shadows and afraid of things unseen
and unreal. Light shall be my guide today. I will follow it where it
leads me, and I will look only on what it shows me. This day I will
experience the peace of true perception.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> These forms of this idea would be helpful for specific
application:</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> <em>This cannot hide the light I will to see.<br /> You stand
with me in light, [name].<br /> In the light this will look different</em>.</p>

<p class="review-lesson">[74] There is no will but Godâ€™s.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> I am safe today because there is no will but Godâ€™s. I can
become afraid only when I believe that there is another will. I try to
attack only when I am afraid, and only when I try to attack can I
believe that my eternal safety is threatened. Today I will recognize
that all this has not occurred. I am safe because there is no will but
Godâ€™s.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup> These are some useful forms of this idea for specific
applications:</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> <em>Let me perceive this in accordance with the Will of
God.<br /> It is Godâ€™s Will you are His Son, [name], and mine as
well.<br /> This is part of Godâ€™s Will for me, however I may see it</em>.</p>
