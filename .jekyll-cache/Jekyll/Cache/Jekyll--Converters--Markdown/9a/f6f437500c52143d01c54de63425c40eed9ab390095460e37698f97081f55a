I"4<p class="lesson-header">My present happiness is all I see.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Unless I look upon what is not there, my present happiness
is all I see. Eyes that begin to open see at last. And I would have
Christ’s vision come to me this very day. What I perceive without God’s
own correction for the sight I made is frightening and painful to
behold. Yet I would not allow my mind to be deceived by the belief the
dream I made is real an instant longer. This the day I seek my present
happiness and look on nothing else except the thing I seek.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>With this resolve, I come to You and ask Your strength to
hold me up today while I but seek to do Your Will. You cannot fail to
hear me, Father. What I ask have You already given me, and I am sure
that I will see my happiness today.</em></p>
