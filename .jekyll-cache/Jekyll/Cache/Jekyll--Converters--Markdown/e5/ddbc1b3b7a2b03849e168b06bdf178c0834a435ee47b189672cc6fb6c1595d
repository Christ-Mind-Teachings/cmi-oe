<p class="review-lesson">[190] I choose the joy of God instead of pain.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <em>Pain is my own idea. It is not<br /> a thought of God, but
one I thought apart<br /> from Him and from His Will. His Will is
joy<br /> and only joy for His beloved Son.<br /> And that I choose
instead of what I made.</em></p>
