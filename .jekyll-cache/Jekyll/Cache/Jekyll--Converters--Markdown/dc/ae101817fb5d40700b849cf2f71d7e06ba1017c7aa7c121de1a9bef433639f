I" <p><sup>101</sup> You no more recognize what is painful than you know what is joyful
and are in fact very apt to confuse the two. The Holy Spiritâ€™s main
function is to teach you <em>to tell them apart</em>. However strange it may
seem that this is necessary, it obviously <em>is.</em> The reason is equally
obvious. What is joyful to you <em>is</em> painful to the ego and, as long as
you are in doubt about what <em>you</em> are, you will be confused about joy
and pain. This confusion is the cause of the whole idea of sacrifice.
Obey the Holy Spirit, and you <em>will</em> be giving up the ego. But you will
be sacrificing <em>nothing</em>. On the contrary, you will be gaining
<em>everything.</em> If you believed this, there would <em>be</em> no conflict.</p>

<p><sup>102</sup> That is why you need to <em>demonstrate</em> the obvious to yourself. It is
<em>not</em> obvious to you. You believe that doing the <em>opposite</em> of Godâ€™s
Will can be better for you. You also believe that it is possible to <em>do</em>
the opposite of Godâ€™s Will. Therefore, you believe that an impossible
choice is open to you and one which is both very fearful <em>and</em> very
desirable. Yet God <em>wills.</em> He does <em>not</em> wish. <em>Your</em> will is as
powerful as His because it <em>is</em> His. The egoâ€™s wishes do not mean
anything, because the ego wishes for the impossible. You can <em>wish</em> for
the impossible, but you can <em>will</em> only with God. This is the egoâ€™s
weakness and <em>your</em> strength.</p>

<p><sup>103</sup> The Holy Spirit <em>always</em> sides with you and with your strength. As
long as you avoid His guidance in any way, you <em>want</em> to be weak. Yet
weakness <em>is</em> frightening. What else, then, can this decision mean
except that you <em>want</em> to be fearful? The Holy Spirit <em>never</em> asks for
sacrifice, but the ego <em>always</em> does. When you are confused about this
<em>very</em> clear distinction in motivation, it can <em>only</em> be due to
projection. Projection of this kind <em>is</em> a confusion in motivation and,
<em>given</em> this confusion, trust becomes impossible.</p>

<p><sup>104</sup> No one obeys gladly a guide he does not trust, but this does not
mean that the <em>guide</em> is untrustworthy. In this case, it <em>always</em> means
that the <em>follower</em> is. However, this too is merely a matter of his own
belief. Believing that <em>he</em> can betray, he believes that everything can
betray <em>him</em>. Yet this is only because he has <em>elected to follow false
guidance</em>. Unable to follow this guidance <em>without</em> fear, he associates
fear <em>with</em> guidance and refuses to follow <em>any</em> guidance at all. [If
the result of this decision is confusion, this is hardly surprising.]
The Holy Spirit is perfectly trustworthy, as <em>you</em> are. God Himself
trusts you, and therefore your trustworthiness <em>is</em> beyond question. It
will always remain beyond question, however much <em>you</em> may question it.</p>

<p><sup>105</sup> We said before that you <em>are</em> the Will of God. His Will is not an
idle wish, and your identification <em>with</em> His Will is not optional,
since it <em>is</em> what you are. Sharing His Will with me is not really open
to choice, though it may seem to be. The whole separation lies in this
fallacy. The only way <em>out</em> of the fallacy is to decide that you do not
have to decide <em>anything</em>. Everything has been given you by Godâ€™s
decision. That <em>is</em> His Will, and you can <em>not</em> undo it. Even the
relinquishment of your false decision-making prerogative, which the ego
guards so jealously, is not accomplished by your wish. It was
accomplished <em>for</em> you by the Will of God, Who has not left you
comfortless. His Voice <em>will</em> teach you how to distinguish between pain
and joy and <em>will</em> lead you out of the confusion which you have made.
There <em>is</em> no confusion in the mind of a Son of God whose will <em>must</em> be
the Will of the Father, because the Fatherâ€™s Will <em>is</em> His Son.</p>

<p><sup>106</sup> Miracles are <em>in accord</em> with the Will of God Whose Will you do not
know, because you are confused about what <em>you</em> will. This means that
you are confused about what you are. If you <em>are</em> Godâ€™s Will and do not
<em>accept</em> His Will[, you can <em>only</em> be not accepting what you are. But
if your joy <em>is</em> what you are], you are denying joy. The miracle is
therefore a lesson in <em>what joy is.</em> Being a lesson in sharing, it is a
lesson in love, which <em>is</em> joy. Every miracle is thus a lesson in truth,
and by offering truth you are learning the difference between pain and
joy.</p>
