I"<p>In the “dynamics” of attack is sacrifice a key idea. It is the pivot
upon which <em>all</em> compromise, <em>all</em> desperate attempts to strike a
bargain, and all conflicts achieve a seeming balance. It is the symbol
of the central theme that <em>somebody must lose</em>. Its focus on the body is
apparent, for it is always an attempt to <em>limit loss</em>. The body is
itself a sacrifice—a giving up of power in the name of saving just a
little for yourself. To see a brother in another body separate from
yours is the expression of a wish to see a little part of him and
sacrifice the rest. Look at the world, and you will see nothing attached
to anything beyond itself. All seeming entities can come a little nearer
or go a little farther off but <em>cannot</em> join.</p>
