I"Ä$<p><sup>3</sup> The body cannot heal because it cannot make itself sick. It <em>needs</em> no
healing. Its health or sickness depends entirely on how the mind
perceives it and the purpose which the mind would use it <em>for</em>. And it
is obvious that a segment of the mind <em>can</em> see itself as separated from
the Universal Purpose. When this occurs, the body becomes its weapon
used <em>against</em> this Purpose to demonstrate the ‚Äúfact‚Äù that separation
has occurred. The body thus becomes the instrument of illusion, acting
accordingly; seeing what is not there, hearing what truth has never
said, and behaving insanely, being imprisoned <em>by</em> insanity.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> Do not overlook our earlier statement that faithlessness leads
straight to illusions. For faithlessness is the perception of a brother
<em>as</em> a body, and the body cannot be used for purposes of union. If,
then, you see your brother as a body, you have established a condition
in which uniting with him becomes impossible. Your faithlessness to him
has separated you from him and kept you <em>both</em> apart from being healed.
Your faithlessness has thus opposed the Holy Spirit‚Äôs purpose and
brought illusions centered on the <em>body</em> to stand between you. And the
body <em>will</em> seem to be sick, for you have made of it an ‚Äúenemy‚Äù of
healing and the opposite of truth.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> It cannot be difficult to realize that faith must be the opposite of
faithlessness. Yet the difference in how they operate is less apparent,
though it follows directly from the fundamental difference in what they
are. Faithlessness would always limit and attack; faith would remove all
limitations and make whole. [Faithlessness would destroy and
<em>separate</em>; faith would unite and <em>heal</em>.] Faithlessness would
interpose illusions between the Son of God and his Creator; faith would
remove all obstacles that seem to rise between them. Faithlessness is
wholly dedicated to illusions; faith wholly to truth. Partial dedication
is impossible. Truth is the <em>absence</em> of illusion; illusion the
<em>absence</em> of truth.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup> Both cannot <em>be</em> together nor perceived in the same place. To dedicate
yourself to both is to set up a goal forever impossible to attain, for
part of it is sought through the body, thought of as a means for seeking
out reality through attack, while the other part would heal and
therefore calls upon the mind and <em>not</em> the body. The inevitable
compromise is the belief that the <em>body</em> must be healed, and <em>not</em> the
mind. For this divided goal has given both an equal reality, which could
be possible only if the mind is limited to the body and divided into
little parts of seeming wholeness but without connection. This will not
harm the body, but it <em>will</em> keep the delusional thought system in the
<em>mind</em>.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> Here then is healing needed. And it is here that healing <em>is</em>. For God
gave healing not <em>apart</em> from sickness, nor established remedy where
sickness cannot be. They are <em>together</em>, and when they are <em>seen</em>
together, all attempts to keep both truth and illusion in the mind,
where both <em>must</em> be, are recognized as dedication to <em>illusion</em> and
given up when brought to truth and seen as totally irreconcilable with
truth in any respect or in any way.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup> Truth and illusion have <em>no</em> connection. This will remain forever
true, however much you seek to connect them. But illusions are <em>always</em>
connected, as is truth. Each is united, a complete thought system, but
totally disconnected to each other. Where there is no overlap, there
separation must be complete. And to perceive this is to recognize where
separation <em>is</em> and where it must be healed. The result of an idea is
never separate from its source. The <em>idea</em> of separation produced the
body and remains connected to it, making it sick because of its
identification with it. You think you are protecting the body by hiding
this connection, for this concealment seems to keep your identification
safe from the ‚Äúattack‚Äù of truth.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup> If you but understood how much this strange concealment has hurt your
mind and how confused your own identification has become because of it!
You do not see how great [is] the devastation wrought by your
faithlessness. For faithlessness is an attack which seems to be
justified by its <em>results.</em> For by withholding faith, you see what <em>is</em>
unworthy of it and cannot look beyond the barrier to what is joined with
you.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup> To have faith is to heal. It is the sign that you have accepted the
Atonement for yourself and would therefore share it. By faith you offer
the gift of freedom from the past, which <em>you</em> received. You do not use
anything your brother has done before to condemn him <em>now</em>. You freely
choose to overlook his errors, looking past all barriers between your
self and his and seeing them as one. And in that one you see your faith
is fully justified. There <em>is</em> no justification for faithlessness, but
faith is <em>always</em> justified.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup> Faith is the opposite of fear, as much a part of love as fear is of
attack. Faith is the acknowledgment of union. It is the gracious
acknowledgment of everyone as a Son of your most loving Father, loved by
Him like you and therefore loved by you as yourself. It is His love that
joins you, and for His love you would keep no one separate from <em>yours</em>.
Each one appears just as he is perceived in the holy instant, united in
your purpose to be released from guilt. You saw the Christ in him, and
he was healed because you looked on what makes faith forever justified
in everyone.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup> Faith is the gift of God, through Him Whom God has given you.
Faithlessness looks upon the Son of God and judges him unworthy of
forgiveness. But through the eyes of faith, the Son of God is seen
<em>already</em> forgiven, free of all the guilt he laid upon himself. Faith
sees him only <em>now</em> because it looks not to the past to judge him, but
would see in him only what it would see in <em>you</em>. It sees not through
the body‚Äôs eyes nor looks to bodies for its justification. It is the
messenger of the new perception sent forth to gather witnesses unto its
coming and to return their messages to you. Faith is as easily exchanged
for knowledge as is the real world. For faith arises from the Holy
Spirit‚Äôs perception and is the sign you share it with Him. Faith is a
gift you offer to the Son of God through Him, and wholly acceptable to
his Father as to him. And therefore offered <em>you</em>.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup> Your holy relationship, with its new purpose, offers you faith to
give unto each other. Your faithlessness had driven you apart, and so
you did not recognize salvation in each other. Yet faith <em>unites</em> you in
the holiness you see, not through the body‚Äôs eyes but in the sight of
Him Who joined you and in Whom <em>you</em> are united. Grace is not given to a
body, but to a <em>mind</em>. And the mind that receives it looks instantly
beyond the body and sees the holy place where it was healed. <em>There</em> is
the altar where the grace was given, in which it stands. Do you, then,
offer grace and blessing to each other, for you stand at the same altar
where grace was laid for <em>both</em> of you. And be you healed by grace
together, that <em>you</em> may heal through faith.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup> In the holy instant, you stand before the altar God has raised unto
Himself and <em>both</em> of you. Lay faithlessness aside and come to it
together. There will you see the miracle of your relationship as it was
made again through faith. And there it is that you will realize that
there is nothing faith cannot forgive. No error interferes with its calm
sight, which brings the miracle of healing with equal ease to <em>all</em> of
them. For what the messengers of love are sent to do <em>they do</em>,
returning the glad tidings that it was done to you who stand together
before the altar from which they were sent forth.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup> As faithlessness will keep your little kingdoms barren and separate,
so will faith help the Holy Spirit prepare the ground for the most holy
garden which He would make of it. For faith brings peace, and so it
calls on truth to enter and make lovely what has already been prepared
for loveliness. Truth follows faith and peace, completing the process of
making lovely which they begin. For faith is still a learning goal, no
longer needed when the lesson has been learned. Yet truth will stay
forever.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup> Let then your dedication be to the eternal and learn how <em>not</em> to
interfere with it and make it slave to time. For what you think you do
to the eternal you do to <em>you</em>. Whom God created as His Son is slave to
nothing, being lord of all along with his Creator. You can enslave a
body, but an <em>idea</em> is free, incapable of being kept in prison or
limited in any way except by the mind that thought it. For it remains
joined to its source, which is its jailor or its liberator, according to
which it chooses as its purpose for itself.</p>
