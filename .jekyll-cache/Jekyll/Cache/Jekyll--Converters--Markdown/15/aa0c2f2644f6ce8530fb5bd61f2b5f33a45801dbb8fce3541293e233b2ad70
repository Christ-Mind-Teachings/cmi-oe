    <p><sup>4</sup> The miracle abolishes the need for lower-order concerns. Since it
is an out-of-pattern time interval, the ordinary considerations of time
and space do not apply. When <em>you</em> perform a miracle, <em>I</em> will arrange both
time and space to adjust to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>5</sup> Clear distinction between what <em>has been</em> created and what <em>is being</em>
created is essential. <em>All</em> forms of correction (or healing) rest on this
<em>fundamental</em> correction in level perception.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>6</sup> Another way of stating the above point is: Never confuse right-
with wrong-mindedness. Responding to <em>any</em> form of miscreation with
anything except <em>a desire to heal</em> (or a miracle) is an expression of this
confusion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>7</sup> The miracle is always a <em>denial</em> of this error and an affirmation of
the truth. Only right-mindedness <em>can</em> create in a way that has any real
effect. Pragmatically, what has no real effect has no real existence.
Its effect, then, is emptiness. Being without substantial content, it
lends itself to projection in the improper sense.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>8</sup> The level-adjustment power of the miracle induces the right
perception for healing. Until this has occurred, healing cannot be
understood. Forgiveness is an empty gesture unless it entails
correction. Without this it is essentially judgmental rather than
healing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>9</sup> Miraculous forgiveness is <em>only</em> correction. It has <em>no</em> element of
judgment at all. ‚ÄúFather forgive them for they know not <em>what</em> they do‚Äù in
no way evaluates what they do. It is strictly limited to an appeal to
God to heal their minds. There is no reference to the outcome of their
mis-thought. <em>That</em> does not matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><sup>10</sup> The biblical injunction, ‚ÄúBe of one mind‚Äù is the statement for
revelation-readiness. My <em>own</em> injunction, ‚ÄúDo this in remembrance of me‚Äù
is the request for cooperation from miracle workers. It should be noted
that the two statements are not in the same order of reality. The latter
involves a time awareness, since to remember implies recalling the past
in the present. Time is under <em>my</em> direction, but Timelessness belongs to
God alone. In time we exist for and with each other. In Timelessness we
coexist with God.</p>
