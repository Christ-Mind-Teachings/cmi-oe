I"<p><sup>43</sup> Only love is strong because it is <em>undivided.</em> The strong do not
attack because they see no need to do so. <em>Before</em> the idea of attack
can enter your mind, you must have <em>perceived</em> yourself as weak. Because
you had attacked yourself and believed that the attack was <em>effective</em>,
you behold yourself as weakened. No longer perceiving yourself and all
your brothers as equal and regarding yourself as <em>weaker</em>, you attempt
to ‚Äúequalize‚Äù the situation <em>you</em> have made. You use attack to do so
because you believe that attack was successful in weakening <em>you</em>.</p>

<p><sup>44</sup> That is why the recognition of your <em>own</em> invulnerability is so
important in the restoration of your sanity. For if you accept your
invulnerability, you are recognizing that attack <em>has</em> no effect.
Although you have attacked yourself, and very brutally, you will
demonstrate that <em>nothing happened</em>. Therefore, by attacking you have
not done <em>anything</em>. Once you realize this, there is no longer any
<em>sense</em> in attack, for it manifestly <em>does not work</em> and <em>cannot</em>
protect you. Yet the recognition of your invulnerability has more than
negative value. If your attacks on yourself have <em>failed</em> to weaken you,
<em>you are still strong</em>. You therefore have no need to ‚Äúequalize‚Äù the
situation to establish your strength.</p>

<p><sup>45</sup> You will never realize the utter uselessness of attack <em>except</em> by
recognizing that your attack on <em>yourself</em> had no effects. For others
<em>do</em> react to attack if they perceive it, and if you are trying to
attack <em>them</em>, you will be unable to avoid interpreting this as
reinforcement. The <em>only</em> place where you can cancel out all
reinforcement is in <em>yourself.</em> For <em>you</em> are always the first point of
your attack, and if <em>this</em> has never been, it <em>has</em> no consequences.</p>

<p><sup>46</sup> The Holy Spirit‚Äôs love is your strength, for yours is divided and
therefore not real. You could not trust your own love when you have
<em>attacked</em> it. You cannot learn of perfect love with a split mind
because a split mind has <em>made</em> itself a poor learner. You tried to make
the separation eternal because you wanted to retain the characteristics
of creation with your own <em>content.</em> Yet creation is <em>not</em> of you, and
poor learners need special teaching. You have learning handicaps in a
very literal sense.</p>

<p><sup>47</sup> There are areas in your learning skills which are so impaired that
you can progress only under constant, clear-cut direction provided by a
Teacher Who can <em>transcend</em> your limited resources. He <em>becomes</em> your
resource because, of <em>yourself</em>, you <em>cannot</em> learn. The learning
situation in which you placed yourself <em>is</em> impossible, and in this
situation you clearly require a special Teacher and a special
curriculum. Poor learners are not good choices for teachers, either for
themselves or for anyone else. You would hardly turn to <em>them</em> to
establish the curriculum by which they can <em>escape</em> from their
limitations. If they understood what is beyond them, they would not <em>be</em>
handicapped.</p>

<p><sup>48</sup> You do not know the meaning of love, and that <em>is</em> your handicap. Do
not attempt to teach yourselves what you do not understand, and do not
try to set up curriculum goals where yours have clearly failed. <em>Your</em>
learning goal has been <em>not</em> to learn, and this <em>cannot</em> lead to
successful learning. You cannot transfer what you have not learned, and
the impairment of the ability to generalize is a crucial learning
failure. Would you ask those who have <em>failed</em> to learn what learning
aids are <em>for</em>? <em>They do not know</em>. For if they could interpret the aids
correctly, they would have learned from them.</p>

<p><sup>49</sup> We have said that the ego‚Äôs rule is, ‚ÄúSeek and do <em>not</em> find.‚Äù
Translated into curricular terms, this is the same as saying, ‚Äú<em>Try</em> to
learn but do <em>not</em> succeed.‚Äù The result of this curriculum goal is
obvious. Every legitimate teaching aid, every real instruction, and
every sensible guide to learning <em>will be misinterpreted</em>. For they are
all for learning facilitation, which this strange curriculum goal is
<em>against</em>. If you are trying to learn how <em>not</em> to learn and are using
the aim of teaching to <em>defeat</em> itself, what can you expect <em>but</em>
confusion? The curriculum does not make <em>sense.</em></p>

<p><sup>50</sup> This kind of ‚Äúlearning‚Äù has so weakened your mind that you <em>cannot</em>
love, for the curriculum you have chosen is <em>against</em> love and amounts
to a course in <em>how to attack yourself</em>. A necessary minor,
supplementing this major curriculum goal, is learning how <em>not</em> to
overcome the split which made this goal believable. And you can <em>not</em>
overcome it, for all <em>your</em> learning is on its <em>behalf</em>. Yet your will
speaks against your learning, as your learning speaks against your will,
and so you fight <em>against</em> learning and succeed, for that <em>is</em> your
will. But you do not realize even yet that there <em>is</em> something you <em>do</em>
will to learn, and that you can learn it because it <em>is</em> your will to do
so.</p>

<p><sup>51</sup> You who have tried to learn what you do <em>not</em> will should take heart,
for although the curriculum you set yourself is depressing indeed, it is
merely ridiculous if you look at it. Is it <em>possible</em> that the way to
achieve a goal is <em>not</em> to attain it? Resign <em>now</em> as your own teachers.
<em>This</em> resignation will <em>not</em> lead to depression. It is merely the
result of an honest appraisal of what you have taught yourselves and of
the learning outcomes which have resulted. Under the proper learning
conditions, which you can neither provide nor understand, you will
become excellent learners <em>and</em> teachers. But it is not so yet and will
not <em>be</em> so until the whole learning situation as <em>you</em> have set it up
is reversed.</p>

<p><sup>52</sup> Your learning <em>potential</em>, properly understood, is limitless because
it will lead you to God. You can <em>teach</em> the way to Him <em>and</em> learn it
if you follow the Teacher Who knows it and His curriculum for learning
it. The curriculum is totally unambiguous because the goal is <em>not</em>
divided, and the means and the end are in <em>complete</em> accord. You need
offer only <em>undivided attention</em>. Everything else will be <em>given</em> you.
For it is <em>your</em> will to learn aright, and nothing can oppose the Will
of God‚Äôs Son. His learning is as unlimited as <em>he</em> is.</p>
