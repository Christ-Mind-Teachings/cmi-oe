I"?<p><sup>86</sup> When you accept a brother’s guiltlessness, you will see the Atonement
in him. For by proclaiming it in him, you make it <em>yours</em>, and you
<em>will</em> see what you sought. You will not see the symbol of your
brother’s guiltlessness shining within him while you still believe it is
not there. <em>His</em> guiltlessness is <em>your</em> Atonement. Grant it to him, and
you will see the truth of what you have acknowledged. Yet truth is
offered <em>first</em> to be received, even as God gave it first to His Son.
The first in time means nothing, but the First in eternity is God the
Father, Who is both First and One. Beyond the First, there is no other,
for there is no order, no second or third and nothing <em>but</em> the First.</p>

<p><sup>87</sup> You who belong to the First Cause, created by Him like unto Himself
and part of Him, are more than merely guiltless. The state of
guiltlessness is only the condition in which what is not there has been
removed from the disordered mind that thought it <em>was</em>. This state, and
only this, must <em>you</em> attain with God beside you. For until you do, you
will still think that you are separate from Him. You can feel His
Presence next to you but <em>cannot</em> know that you are one with Him. This
need not be taught. Learning applies only to the condition in which it
happens <em>of itself</em>.</p>

<p><sup>88</sup> When you have let all that obscured the truth in your most holy mind
be undone for you and stand in grace before your Father, He will give
Himself to you as He has always done. Giving Himself is all He knows,
and so it is all knowledge. For what He knows not cannot be and
therefore cannot be given. Ask not to be forgiven, for this has already
been accomplished. Ask, rather, to learn how to <em>forgive</em> and restore
what always was to your unforgiving mind. Atonement becomes real and
visible to them that <em>use</em> it. On earth this is your only function, and
you must learn that it is all you <em>want</em> to learn.</p>

<p><sup>89</sup> You <em>will</em> feel guilty till you learn this. For in the end, whatever
form it takes, your guilt arises from your failure to fulfill your
function in God’s Mind with all of <em>yours</em>. Can you escape this guilt by
failing to fulfill your function here? You need not understand creation
to do what must be done before that knowledge would be meaningful to
you. God breaks no barriers; neither did He <em>make</em> them. When <em>you</em>
release them, they are gone. God will not fail nor ever has in anything.</p>

<p><sup>90</sup> Decide that God is right and <em>you</em> are wrong about yourself. He
created you out of Himself but still within Him. He <em>knows</em> what you
are. Remember that there is no second to Him. There cannot, therefore,
be anyone without His Holiness nor anyone unworthy of His perfect Love.
Fail not in your function of loving in a loveless place made out of
darkness and deceit, for thus are darkness and deceit undone. Fail not
<em>yourself</em>, but instead offer to God <em>and you</em> His blameless Son. For
this small gift of appreciation for His Love, God will Himself exchange
your gift for His.</p>

<p><sup>91</sup> Before you make <em>any</em> decisions for yourself, remember that you have
decided <em>against</em> your function in Heaven and consider carefully whether
you <em>want</em> to make decisions here. Your function here is only to decide
<em>against</em> deciding what you want in recognition that you do not <em>know.</em>
How, then, can you decide what you should do? Leave all decisions to the
One Who speaks for God and for your function as He <em>knows</em> it. So will
He teach you to remove the awful burden you have laid upon yourself by
loving not the Son of God and trying to teach him guilt instead of love.
Give up this frantic and insane attempt, which cheats you of the joy of
living with your God and Father, and awaking gladly to His love and
holiness, which join together as the truth in you, making you one with
Him.</p>

<p><sup>92</sup> When you have learned how to decide <em>with</em> God, all decisions become
as easy and as right as breathing. There is no effort, and you will be
led as gently as if you were being carried along a quiet path in summer.
Only your own volition seems to make deciding hard. The Holy Spirit will
not delay at all in answering your <em>every</em> question what to do. He
<em>knows</em>. And He will <em>tell</em> you and then do it <em>for</em> you. You who are
tired might consider whether this is not more restful than sleep. For
you can bring your guilt into sleeping but not into this.</p>
