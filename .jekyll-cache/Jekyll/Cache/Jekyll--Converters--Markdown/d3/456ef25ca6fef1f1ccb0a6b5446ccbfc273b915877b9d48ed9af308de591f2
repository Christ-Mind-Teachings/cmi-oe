I"b<p class="lesson-header">Let me forget my brother’s past today.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <em>This is the thought that leads the way to You and brings
me to my goal. I cannot come to You without my brother. And to know my
Source, I first must recognize what You created one with me. My
brother’s is the hand that leads me on the way to You. His sins are in
the past along with mine. And I am saved because the past is gone. Let
me not cherish it within my heart or I will lose the way to walk to You.
My brother is my savior. Let me not attack the savior You have given me.
But let me honor him who bears Your Name and so remember that It is my
own.</em></p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Forgive me, then, today. And you will know you have
forgiven me if you behold your brother in the light of holiness. He
cannot be less holy than can I, and you cannot be holier than he.</p>
