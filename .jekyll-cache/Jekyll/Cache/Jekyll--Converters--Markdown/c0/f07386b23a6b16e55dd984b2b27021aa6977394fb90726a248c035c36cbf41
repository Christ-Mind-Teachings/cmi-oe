I"ê<p><sup>23</sup> When you are weary, remember you have hurt yourself. Your Comforter
will rest you, but <em>you</em> cannot. You do not know <em>how</em>, for if you did
you could never have grown weary. Unless you have hurt yourselves, you
could never suffer in <em>any</em> way, for that is not God‚Äôs Will for His Son.
Pain is not of Him, for He knows no attack and His peace surrounds you
silently. God is very quiet, for there is no conflict in Him. Conflict
is the root of all evil, for being blind, it does not see whom it
attacks. Yet it <em>always</em> attacks the Son of God, and the Son of God is
<em>you</em>.</p>

<p><sup>24</sup> God‚Äôs Son is indeed in need of comfort, for he knows not what he
does, believing his will is not his own. The Kingdom is his, and yet he
wanders homelessly. At home in God, he is lonely, and amid all his
brothers, he is friendless. Would God <em>let</em> this be real if He did not
will to be alone Himself? And if your will is His, it cannot be true of
you <em>because</em> it is not true of Him. Oh, my children, if you knew what
God wills for you, your joy would be complete! And what He wills <em>has</em>
happened, for it was <em>always</em> true.</p>

<p><sup>25</sup> When the light comes and you have said, ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs Will is mine,‚Äù you
will see such beauty that you will <em>know</em> it is not of you. Out of your
joy you will create beauty in His name, for <em>your</em> joy could no more be
contained than His. The bleak little world will vanish into nothingness,
and your heart will be so filled with joy that it will leap into Heaven
and into the Presence of God. I cannot tell you what this will be like,
for your hearts are not ready. Yet I <em>can</em> tell you and remind you often
that what God wills for Himself He wills for <em>you</em>, and what He wills
for you <em>is</em> yours.</p>

<p><sup>26</sup> The way is not hard, but it <em>is</em> very different. Yours is the way of
pain, of which God knows nothing. <em>That</em> way is hard indeed and very
lonely. Fear and grief are your guests, and they go with you and abide
with you on the way. But the dark journey is not the way of God‚Äôs Son.
Walk in light, and do not see the dark companions, for they are not fit
companions for the Son of God, who was created <em>of</em> light and <em>in</em>
light. The Great Light always surrounds you and shines out <em>from</em> you.
How can you see the dark companions in a light such as this? If you see
<em>them</em>, it is only because you are <em>denying</em> the light. But deny <em>them</em>
instead, for the light is here, and the way is clear.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup> God hides nothing from His Son, even though His Son would hide
himself. Yet the Son of God cannot hide his glory, for God wills him to
be glorious and gave him the light that shines in him. You will never
lose your way, for God leads you. When you wander, you but undertake a
journey which is not real. The dark companions, the dark way, are all
illusions. Turn toward the light, for the little spark in you is part of
a light so great that it can sweep you out of all darkness forever. For
your Father <em>is</em> your Creator, and you <em>are</em> like Him.</p>

<p><sup>28</sup> The children of light cannot abide in darkness, for darkness is not
in them. Do not be deceived by the dark comforters, and never let them
enter the Mind of God‚Äôs Son, for they have no place in His temple. When
you are tempted to deny Him, remember that there <em>are</em> no other gods
that you can place before Him, and accept His Will for you in peace. For
you <em>cannot</em> accept it otherwise.</p>

<p><sup>29</sup> Only God‚Äôs Comforter <em>can</em> comfort you. In the quiet of His temple,
He waits to give you the peace that is yours. <em>Give</em> His peace that you
may enter the temple and find it waiting for you. But be holy in the
Presence of God, or you will not know that you are there. For what is
unlike God cannot enter His Mind because it was not His Thought and
therefore does not belong to Him. And <em>your</em> minds must be as pure as
His if you would know what belongs to <em>you.</em> Guard carefully His temple,
for He Himself dwells there and abides in peace. You cannot enter God‚Äôs
Presence with the dark companions beside you, but you also cannot enter
alone.</p>

<p><sup>30</sup> <em>All</em> your brothers must enter <em>with</em> you, for until you have
accepted them, <em>you</em> cannot enter. For you cannot understand Wholeness
unless <em>you</em> are whole, and no part of the Son can be excluded if he
would know the Wholeness of his Father. In your mind, you can accept the
whole Sonship and bless it with the light your Father gave it. Then you
will be worthy to dwell in the temple <em>with</em> Him because it is <em>your</em>
will not to be alone. God blessed His Son forever. If you will bless him
in time, you will <em>be</em> in eternity. Time cannot separate you from God if
you use it on <em>behalf</em> of the eternal.</p>
