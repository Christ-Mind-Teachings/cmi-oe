I" <p><sup>70</sup> Whenever you deny a blessing to a brother, <em>you</em> will feel deprived.
This is because denial is as total as love. It is as impossible to deny
part of the Sonship as it is to love it in part. Nor is it possible to
love it totally <em>at times</em>. You cannot be <em>totally</em> committed
<em>sometimes</em>. Remember a very early lesson—“Never underestimate the power
of denial.” It has no power in itself, but you can give it the power of
<em>your</em> mind, whose power is without limit of any kind. If you use it to
deny reality, reality <em>is</em> gone for you. <em>Reality cannot be partly
appreciated</em>. That is why denying any part of it means you have lost
awareness of <em>all</em> of it.</p>

<p><sup>71</sup> That is the negative side of the law as it operates in this world.
Yet denial is a defense, and so it is as capable of being used
positively as it is of being used destructively. Used negatively it
<em>will</em> be destructive because it will be used for attack, but in the
service of the Holy Spirit, [the law becomes as beneficent as all of
the laws of God. Stated positively,] the law requires you to recognize
only <em>part</em> of reality to appreciate <em>all</em> of it. Mind is too powerful
to be subject to exclusion. You will <em>never</em> be able to exclude yourself
from what you project.</p>

<p><sup>72</sup> When a brother acts insanely, he is offering you an opportunity to
bless him. His need is <em>yours</em>. You <em>need</em> the blessing you can offer
him. There is no way for you to have it <em>except</em> by giving it. This is
the law of God, and it has <em>no</em> exceptions. What you deny you <em>lack</em>,
not because it <em>is</em> lacking, but because you have denied it in another
and are therefore not aware of it in <em>you</em>. Every response you make is
determined by what you <em>think</em> you are, and what you <em>want</em> to be <em>is</em>
what you think you are. Therefore, what you want to be determines every
response you make.</p>

<p><sup>73</sup> You do not need God’s blessing since that you have forever, but you
<em>do</em> need <em>yours.</em> The picture you see of yourselves is deprived,
unloving, and very vulnerable. You <em>cannot</em> love this. Yet you can very
easily escape from it or, better, leave it behind. You are not <em>there</em>,
and that is not <em>you</em>. Do not see this picture in anyone, or you have
accepted it <em>as</em> you. <em>All</em> illusions about the Sonship are dispelled
together, as they were <em>made</em> together. Teach no one that he is what
<em>you</em> would <em>not</em> want to be. Your brother is the mirror in which you
will see the image of yourself as long as perception lasts. And
perception <em>will</em> last until the Sonship knows itself as whole.</p>

<p><sup>74</sup> You made perception, and it must last as long as you <em>want</em> it.
Illusions are investments. They will last as long as you value them.
Values are relative, but they are powerful because they are mental
judgments. The only way to dispel illusions is to withdraw <em>all</em>
investment from them, and they will have no life for you, because you
have put them <em>out of your mind</em>. While you include them <em>in</em> it, you
are <em>giving</em> life to them, except there is nothing there to receive your
gift.</p>

<p><sup>75</sup> The gift of life <em>is</em> yours to give because it was given <em>you.</em> You
are unaware of your gift, <em>because</em> you do not give it. You cannot make
nothing live since it cannot <em>be</em> enlivened. Therefore, you are not
extending the gift you both <em>have</em> and <em>are</em>, and so you do not know
your being. <em>All</em> confusion comes from not extending life, since that is
<em>not</em> the Will of your Creator. You can do nothing apart from Him, and
you <em>do</em> do nothing apart from Him. Keep His way to remember yourselves
and teach His way, lest you forget yourselves. Give only honor to the
Sons of the living God and count yourselves among them gladly.</p>

<p><sup>76</sup> <em>Only</em> honor is a fitting gift for those whom God Himself created
worthy of honor and whom He honors. Give them the appreciation which God
accords them always, because they are His beloved Sons in whom He is
well pleased. You cannot <em>be</em> apart from them, because you are not apart
from Him. Rest in His love and protect your rest by loving. But love
<em>everything</em> He created of which you are a part, or you cannot learn of
His peace and accept His gift for <em>yourself</em> and <em>as</em> yourself. You
cannot know your own perfection until you have honored all those who
were created <em>like</em> you.</p>

<p><sup>77</sup> One Child of God is the <em>only</em> teacher sufficiently worthy to teach
another. One Teacher is in all your minds, and He teaches the same
lesson to all. He always teaches you the inestimable worth of <em>every</em>
Son of God, teaching it with infinite patience born of the [love of Him
for whom] He speaks. Every attack is a call for His patience, since
<em>only</em> His patience can translate attack into blessing. Those who attack
do not <em>know</em> they are blessed. They attack because they believe they
are <em>deprived</em>. Give therefore of <em>your</em> abundance and teach your
brothers <em>theirs</em>. Do not share their delusions of scarcity, or you will
perceive <em>yourself</em> as lacking.</p>

<p><sup>78</sup> Attack could never promote attack unless you perceived it as a means
of depriving you of something you <em>want</em>. Yet you cannot <em>lose</em> anything
unless <em>you</em> did not value it and therefore did not <em>want</em> it. This
makes you feel <em>deprived</em> of it, and by projecting your own rejection,
you believe that others are taking it <em>from</em> you. One <em>must</em> be fearful
if he believes that his brother is attacking him to tear the Kingdom of
Heaven from him. This is the ultimate basis for <em>all</em> of the ego’s
projection.</p>

<p><sup>79</sup> Being the part of your mind which does not believe it is responsible
for <em>itself</em> and being without allegiance to God, the ego is incapable
of trust. Projecting its insane belief that <em>you</em> have been treacherous
to <em>your</em> Creator, it believes that your brothers, who are as incapable
of this as <em>you</em> are, are out to take God <em>from</em> you. Whenever a brother
attacks another, this <em>is</em> what he believes. Projection <em>always</em> sees
your will in others. If you will to separate yourself from God, that
<em>is</em> what you will think others are doing <em>to</em> you.</p>

<p><sup>80</sup> You <em>are</em> the Will of God. Do not accept anything else <em>as</em> your
will, or you are denying what you are. Deny this and you <em>will</em> attack,
believing you have <em>been</em> attacked. But see the love of God in you, and
you will see it everywhere, because it <em>is</em> everywhere. See His
abundance in everyone, and you will know that you are in Him <em>with</em>
them. They are part of you, as you are part of God. <em>You</em> are as lonely
without understanding this as God Himself is lonely when His Sons do not
know Him. The peace of God <em>is</em> understanding this. There is only one
way <em>out</em> of the world’s thinking, just as there was only one way <em>into</em>
it. Understand totally by understanding <em>totality</em>.</p>

<p><sup>81</sup> Perceive <em>any</em> part of the ego’s thought system as wholly insane,
wholly delusional, and wholly undesirable, and you have correctly
evaluated <em>all</em> of it. This correction enables you to perceive <em>any</em>
part of creation as wholly real, wholly perfect, and <em>wholly desirable.</em>
Wanting this <em>only</em>, you will <em>have</em> this only, and giving this only,
you will <em>be</em> only this. The gifts you offer to the ego are <em>always</em>
experienced as sacrifices, but the gifts you offer to the Kingdom are
gifts to <em>you.</em> They will always be treasured by God, because they
belong to His beloved Sons who belong to Him. All power and glory are
yours, <em>because</em> the Kingdom is His.</p>
