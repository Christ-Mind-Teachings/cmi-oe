I"<p><sup>102</sup> You are involved in unconscious distortions which are producing a
dense cover over miracle impulses and which make it hard for them to
reach consciousness. The nature of any interpersonal relationship is
limited or defined by what you want it to <em>do</em>. Relating is a way of
achieving an outcome. The danger of defenses lies in their propensity
for holding misperceptions rigidly in place. All actions which stem from
reverse thinking are literally the behavioral expressions of those who
know not what they do. A rigid orientation can be extremely reliable,
even if it is upside-down. In fact, the more consistently upside-down it
is, the <em>more</em> reliable it is.</p>

<p><sup>103</sup> However, validity is still the ultimate goal, which reliability can
only serve. Hostility, triumph, vengeance, self-debasement, and all
kinds of expressions of lack of love are often very clearly seen in the
fantasies which accompany them. But it is a <em>profound</em> error to imagine
that because these fantasies are so frequent or occur so reliably that
this implies validity. Remember that while validity implies reliability,
the relationship is <em>not</em> reversible. You can be wholly reliable and
<em>entirely</em> wrong. While a reliable instrument <em>does</em> measure something, what
<em>use</em> is it unless you discover what the “something” is? This course,
then, will concentrate on validity and let reliability fall naturally
into place.</p>

<p><sup>104</sup> The confusion of miracle impulses with physical impulses is a major
source of perceptual distortion because it <em>induces</em>, rather than
straightens out, the basic level confusion which underlies the
perception of all those who seek happiness with the instruments of this
world. Inappropriate physical impulses (or misdirected miracle impulses)
result in conscious guilt if expressed and depression if denied. <em>All</em>
real pleasure comes from doing God’s Will. This is because <em>not</em> doing it
is a denial of self. <em>Denial</em> of error results in projection. <em>Correction</em>
of error brings release. “Lead us not into temptation” means “do not let
us deceive ourselves into believing that we can relate in peace to God
or to our brothers with <em>anything</em> external.”</p>

<p><sup>105</sup> Child of God, you were created to create the good, the beautiful,
and the holy. Do not lose sight of this. The love of God for a little
while must still be expressed through one body to another, because the
real vision is still so dim. Everyone can use his body best by enlarging
man’s perception so he can see the <em>real</em> vision. <em>This</em> vision is
invisible to the physical eye. The ultimate purpose of the body is to
render itself unnecessary.  Learning to do this is the only real reason
for its creation.</p>

<p><sup>106</sup> Fantasies of any kind are distorted forms of thinking, because they
<em>always</em> involve twisting perception into unreality. Fantasy is a debased
form of vision. Vision and revelation are closely related, while fantasy
and projection are more closely associated, because both attempt to
control external reality according to false internal needs.  Twist
reality in <em>any</em> way, and you are perceiving destructively. Reality was
lost through usurpation, which in turn produced tyranny. I told you that
you are now restored to your former role in the plan of Atonement, but
you must still choose freely to devote yourselves to the greater
restoration. As long as a single slave remains to walk the earth, your
release is not complete. <em>Complete</em> restoration of the Sonship is the only
true goal of the miracle-minded.</p>

<p><sup>107</sup> No fantasies are true. They are distortions of perception by
definition. They are a means of making false associations and obtaining
pleasure from them. Man can do this only because he is creative. But,
although he can perceive false associations, he can never make them real
<em>except to himself</em>. Man believes in what he creates. If he creates
miracles, he will be equally strong in his belief in <em>them</em>. The strength
of <em>his</em> conviction will then sustain the belief of the miracle receiver.
And fantasies become totally unnecessary as the wholly satisfying nature
of reality becomes apparent to both.</p>
