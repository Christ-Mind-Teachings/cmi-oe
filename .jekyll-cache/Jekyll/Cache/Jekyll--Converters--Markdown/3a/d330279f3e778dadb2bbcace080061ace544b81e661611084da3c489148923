I"•<p class="lesson-header">Fear binds the world. Forgiveness sets it free.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> The ego makes illusions. Truth undoes its evil dreams by
shining them away. Truth never makes attack. It merely is. And by its
presence is the mind recalled from fantasies, awaking to the Real.
Forgiveness bids this presence enter in and take its rightful place
within the mind. Without forgiveness is the mind in chains, believing in
its own futility. Yet with forgiveness does the light shine through the
dream of darkness, offering it hope and giving it the means to realize
the freedom that is its inheritance.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>We would not bind the world again today. Fear holds it
prisoner. And yet Your Love has given us the means to set it free.
Father, we would release it now. For as we offer freedom, it is given
us. And we would not remain as prisoners while You hold out our freedom
unto us.</em></p>
