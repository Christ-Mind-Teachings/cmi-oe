I"3<p class="lesson-header">I can give up but what was never real.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> I sacrifice illusions, nothing more. And as illusions go, I
find the gifts illusions tried to hide, awaiting me in shining welcome
and in readiness to give God’s ancient messages to me. His memory abides
in every gift that I receive of Him. And every dream serves only to
conceal the Self which is God’s only Son, the likeness of Himself, the
Holy One who still abides in Him forever, as He still abides in me.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>Father, to You all sacrifice remains forever
inconceivable. And so I cannot sacrifice except in dreams. As You
created me, I can give up nothing You gave me. What You did not give has
no reality. What loss can I anticipate except the loss of fear and the
return of Love into my mind?</em></p>
