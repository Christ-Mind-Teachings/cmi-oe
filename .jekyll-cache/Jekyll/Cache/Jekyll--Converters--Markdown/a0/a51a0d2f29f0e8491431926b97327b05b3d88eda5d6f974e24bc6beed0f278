I"”<p class="lesson-header">I am forever an effect of God.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <em>Father, I was created in Your Mind, a holy thought that
never left its home. I am forever Your Effect, and You forever and
forever are my Cause. As You created me, I have remained. Where You
established me, I still abide, and all Your attributes abide in me
because it is Your will to have a Son so like his Cause that Cause and
Its Effect are indistinguishable. Let me know that I am an Effect of
God, and so I have the power to create like You. And as it is in Heaven,
so on earth. Your plan I follow here, and at the end I know that You
will gather Your Effects into the tranquil Heaven of Your Love, where
earth will disappear and separate thoughts unite in glory as the Son of
God.</em></p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Let us today behold earth disappear, at first transformed,
and then, forgiven, fade entirely into Godâ€™s holy Will.</p>
