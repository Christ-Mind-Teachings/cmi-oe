I"¹<p class="lesson-header">I will not hurt myself again today.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Let us this day accept forgiveness as our only function.
Why should we attack our minds and give them images of pain? Why should
we teach them they are powerless when God holds out His power and His
love and bids them take what is already theirs? The mind that is made
willing to accept Godâ€™s gifts has been restored to Spirit and extends
its freedom and its joy, as is the Will of God united with its own. The
Self which God created cannot sin and therefore cannot suffer. Let us
choose today that He be our Identity and thus escape forever from all
things the dream of fear appears to offer us.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>Father, Your Son cannot be hurt. And if we think we
suffer, we but fail to know our one Identity we share with You. We would
return to It today, to be made free forever from all our mistakes and to
be saved from what we thought we were.</em></p>
