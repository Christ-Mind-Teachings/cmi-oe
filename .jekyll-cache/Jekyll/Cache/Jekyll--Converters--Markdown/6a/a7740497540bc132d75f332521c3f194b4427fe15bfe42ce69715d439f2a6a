I"<p><sup>10</sup> You still think holiness is difficult because you cannot see how it
can be extended to include everyone. And you have learned that it <em>must</em>
include everyone to <em>be</em> holy. Concern yourselves not with the extension
of holiness, for the nature of miracles you do not understand. Nor do
<em>you</em> do them. It is their extension, far beyond the limits you
perceive, that demonstrates you did <em>not</em> do them. Why should you worry
how the miracle extends to all the Sonship when you do not understand
the miracle itself? One attribute is no more difficult to understand
than is the whole. If miracles <em>are</em> at all, their attributes would
<em>have</em> to be miraculous, being part of them.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup> There is a tendency to fragment and then to be concerned about the
truth of just a little part of the whole. And this is but a way of
avoiding or <em>looking away</em> from the whole to what you think you might be
better able to understand. For this is but another way in which you
would still try to keep understanding to <em>yourself</em>. A better and <em>far</em>
more helpful way to think of miracles is this: You do not understand
them, either in part <em>or</em> whole. Yet you have <em>done</em> them. Therefore,
your understanding cannot be necessary. Yet it is still impossible to
accomplish what you do not understand. And so there must be something in
you that <em>does</em> understand.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup> To you the miracle <em>cannot</em> seem natural because what you have done
to hurt your minds has made them so <em>unnatural</em> that they do not
remember what is natural to them. And when you are <em>told</em> about it, you
cannot understand it. The recognition of the part as whole and of the
whole in every part is <em>perfectly</em> natural. For it is the way God
thinks, and what is natural to Him <em>is</em> natural to you. Wholly natural
perception would show you instantly that order of difficulty in miracles
is quite impossible, for it involves a contradiction of what miracles
mean. And if you could understand their meaning, their attributes could
hardly cause you perplexity.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup> You <em>have</em> done miracles, but it is quite apparent that you have not
done them alone. You have succeeded whenever you have reached another
mind and <em>joined</em> with it. When two minds join as one and share one idea
equally, the first link in the awareness of the Sonship as one has been
made. When you have made this joining as the Holy Spirit bids you and
have offered it to Him to use as He knows how, His natural perception of
your gift enables <em>Him</em> to understand it and <em>you</em> to use His
understanding on your behalf. It is impossible to convince you of the
reality of what has clearly <em>been</em> accomplished through your
willingness, as long as you believe that <em>you</em> must understand it or
else it is not real.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup> You think your lack of understanding is a <em>loss</em> to you, and so you
are unwilling to believe that what has happened is true. But can you
<em>really</em> believe that all that has happened, even though you do <em>not</em>
understand it, has <em>not</em> happened? Yet this <em>is</em> your position. You
would have perfect faith in the Holy Spirit and in the effects of His
teaching if you were not afraid to <em>acknowledge</em> what He taught you. For
this acknowledgment means that what has happened you do not understand
but that you are willing to accept it <em>because</em> it has happened.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup> How can faith in reality be yours while you are bent on making it
unreal? And are you <em>really</em> safer in maintaining the unreality of what
has happened than you would be in joyously accepting it for what it is
and giving thanks for it? Honor the truth that has been given you, and
be glad you do not understand it. Miracles are natural to God and to the
One Who speaks for Him. For His task is to translate the miracle into
the knowledge which it represents and which is lost to you. Let His
understanding of the miracle be enough for you, and do not turn away
from all the witnesses that He has given you to His reality.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup> No evidence will convince you of the truth of what you do not want.
Yet your relationship with Him <em>is</em> real and <em>has</em> been demonstrated.
Regard this not with fear but with rejoicing. The One you called upon
<em>is</em> with you. Bid Him welcome and honor His witnesses, who bring you
the glad tidings He has come. It is true, just as you fear, that to
acknowledge Him <em>is</em> to deny all that you think you know. But it was
<em>never</em> true. What gain is there to you in clinging to it and denying
the evidence for truth? For you have come too near to truth to renounce
it now, and you <em>will</em> yield to its compelling attraction. You can delay
this now but only a little while. The Host of God has called to you, and
you <em>have</em> heard. Never again will you be wholly willing not to listen.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup> This is a year of joy in which your listening will increase, and
peace will grow with its increase. The power of holiness and the
<em>weakness</em> of attack have <em>both</em> been brought into awareness. And this
has been accomplished in minds firmly convinced that holiness is
weakness and attack is power. Should not this be a sufficient miracle to
teach you that your Teacher is <em>not</em> of you? But remember also that
whenever you have listened to His interpretation, the results have
brought you joy. Would you prefer the results of <em>your</em> interpretation,
considering honestly what they have been? God wills you better. Could
you not look with greater charity on whom God loves with perfect love?</p>

<p><sup>18</sup> Do not interpret <em>against</em> Godâ€™s Love, for you have many witnesses
which speak of it so clearly that only the blind and deaf could fail to
see and hear them. This year, determine not to deny what has been given
you by God[. Awake and share it], for that is the only reason He has
called to you. His Voice has spoken clearly, and yet you have so little
faith in what you heard because you have preferred to place still
greater faith in the disaster <em>you</em> have made. Today let us resolve
<em>together</em> to accept the joyful tidings that disaster is not real and
that reality is not disaster.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup> Reality is safe and sure and wholly kind to everyone and everything.
There is no greater love than to accept this and be glad. For love asks
only that you be <em>happy</em> and will give you everything that makes for
happiness. You have never given any problem to the Holy Spirit He has
not solved for you, nor will you ever do so. You have never tried to
solve anything yourself and been successful. Is it not time you brought
these facts <em>together</em> and made <em>sense</em> of them?</p>

<p><sup>20</sup> This is the year for the <em>application</em> of the ideas which have been
given you. For the ideas are mighty forces to be used and not held idly
by. They have already proved their power sufficiently for you to place
your faith in them and not in their denial. This year invest in truth,
and let it work in peace. Have faith in what has faith in <em>you</em>. Think
what you have <em>really</em> seen and heard and <em>recognize</em> it. Can you be
alone with witnesses like these?</p>
