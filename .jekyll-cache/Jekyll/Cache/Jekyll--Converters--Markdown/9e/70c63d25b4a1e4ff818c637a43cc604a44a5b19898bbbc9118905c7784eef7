I"¯<p class="lesson-header">Let me remember God created me.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <em>Father, I did not make myself, although in my insanity I
thought I did. Yet as Your thought, I have not left my Source, remaining
part of What created me. Your Son, my Father, calls on You today. Let me
remember You created me. Let me remember my Identity. And let my
sinlessness arise again before Christâ€™s vision, through which I would
look upon my brothers and myself today</em>.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Now is our Source remembered, and therein we find our true
Identity at last. Holy indeed are we because our Source can know no sin.
And we who are His Sons are like each other and alike to Him.</p>
