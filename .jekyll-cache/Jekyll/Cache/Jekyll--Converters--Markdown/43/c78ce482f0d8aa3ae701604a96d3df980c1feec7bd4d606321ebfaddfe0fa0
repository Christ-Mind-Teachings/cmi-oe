I"a<p class="lesson-header">Today belongs to Love. Let me not fear.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <em>Father, today I would let all things be as You created
them and give Your Son the honor due his sinlessness, the love of
brother to his brother and his friend. Through this I am redeemed.
Through this as well the truth will enter where illusions were, light
will replace all darkness, and Your Son will know he is as You created
him.</em></p>

<p><sup>2</sup> A special blessing comes to us today from Him Who is our
Father. Give this day to Him and there will be no fear today because the
day is given unto Love.</p>
