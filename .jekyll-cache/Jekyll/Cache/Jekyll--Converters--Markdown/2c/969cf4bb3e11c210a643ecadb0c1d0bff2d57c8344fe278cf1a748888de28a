I"ü<p class="lesson-header">Let all things be exactly as they are.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <em>Let me not be Your critic, Lord, today, and judge against
You. Let me not attempt to interfere with Your creation and distort it
into sickly forms. Let me be willing to withdraw my wishes from its
unity and thus to let it be as You created it. For thus will I be able,
too, to recognize my Self as You created me. In Love was I created, and
in Love will I remain forever. What can frighten me when I let all
things be exactly as they are.</em></p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Let not our sight be blasphemous today nor let our ears
attend to lying tongues. Only reality is free of pain. Only reality is
free of loss. Only reality is wholly safe. And it is only this we seek
today.</p>
