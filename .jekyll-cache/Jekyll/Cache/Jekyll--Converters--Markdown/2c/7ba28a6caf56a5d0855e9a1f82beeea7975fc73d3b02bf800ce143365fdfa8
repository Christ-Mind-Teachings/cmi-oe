I"Z#<p><sup>30</sup> A little hindrance can seem large indeed to those who do not
understand that miracles are all the same. Yet teaching that is what
this course is <em>for</em>. This is its only purpose, for only that is all
there is to learn. And you can learn it many different ways. All
learning is a help or hindrance to the gate of Heaven. Nothing in
between is possible. There are two teachers only, who point in different
ways. And you will go along the way your chosen teacher leads. There are
but two directions you can take while time remains and choice is
meaningful. For never will another road be made except the way to
Heaven. You but choose whether to go <em>toward</em> Heaven or away to nowhere.
There <em>is</em> nothing else to choose.</p>

<p><sup>31</sup> Nothing is ever lost but time, which in the end is [nothing. It] is
but a little hindrance to eternity, quite meaningless to the real
Teacher of the world. Yet since you <em>do</em> believe in [its reality], why
should you waste it going nowhere when it <em>can</em> be used to reach a goal
as high as learning can achieve? Think not the way to Heaven’s gate is
difficult at all. Nothing you undertake with certain purpose and high
resolve and happy confidence, holding each other’s hand and keeping step
to Heaven’s song, is difficult to do. But it is hard indeed to wander
off, alone and miserable, down a road which leads to nothing and which
has no purpose.</p>

<p><sup>32</sup> God gave His Teacher to replace the one you made, not to conflict
with it. And what He would replace has been replaced. Time lasted but an
instant in your mind, with no effect upon eternity. And so is all time
passed and everything exactly as it was before the way to nothingness
was made. The tiny tick of time in which the first mistake was made, and
all of them within that one mistake, held also the <em>Correction</em> for that
one and all of them that came within the first. And in that tiny instant
time was gone, for that was all it ever was. What God gave Answer to
<em>is</em> answered and is gone.</p>

<p><sup>33</sup> To you who still believe you live in time and know not it is gone,
the Holy Spirit still guides you through the infinitely small and
senseless maze you still perceive in time, though it has long since
gone. You think you live in what is past. Each thing you look upon you
saw but for an instant, long ago before its unreality gave way to truth.
Not one illusion still remains unanswered in your mind. Uncertainty was
brought to certainty so long ago that it is hard indeed to hold it to
your heart as if it were before you still.</p>

<p><sup>34</sup> The tiny instant you would keep and make eternal passed away in
Heaven too soon for anything to notice it had come. What disappeared too
quickly to affect the simple knowledge of the Son of God can hardly
still be there for you to choose to be your teacher. Only in the past—an
ancient past, too short to make a world in answer to creation—did this
world appear to rise. So very long ago, for such a tiny interval of time
that not one note in Heaven’s song was missed.</p>

<p><sup>35</sup> Yet in each unforgiving act or thought, in every judgment, and in all
belief in sin, is that one instant still called back, as if it could be
made again in time. You keep an ancient memory before your eyes. And he
who lives in memories alone is unaware of where he is.</p>

<p><sup>36</sup> [Forgiveness is the great release from time. It is the key to
learning that the past is over. Madness speaks no more. There <em>is</em> no
other teacher and no <em>other</em> way. For what has been undone no longer is.
And who can stand upon a distant shore and dream himself across an ocean
to a place and time that have long since gone by? How <em>real</em> a hindrance
can this dream be to where he really <em>is</em>? For this is fact and does
<em>not</em> change whatever dreams he has. Yet can he still <em>imagine</em> he is
elsewhere and in another time. In the extreme, he can delude himself
that this is true and pass from mere imagining into belief and into
madness, quite convinced that where he would prefer to be, he <em>is</em>.] <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><sup>37</sup> Is this a <em>hindrance</em> to the place whereon he stands? Is any echo
from the past that he may hear a fact in what is there to hear where he
is now? And how much can his own delusions about time and place affect a
change in where he really is? The unforgiven is a voice that calls out
from a past forever more gone by. And everything which points to it as
real is but a wish that what is gone could be made real again and seen
as here and now in place of what is <em>really</em> now and here. Is this a
hindrance to the truth the past is gone and cannot be returned to you?
And do you <em>want</em> that fearful instant kept, when Heaven seemed to
disappear and God was feared and made a symbol of your hate?</p>

<p><sup>38</sup> Forget the time of terror that has been so long ago corrected and
undone. Can sin withstand the Will of God? Can it be up to you to see
the past and put it in the present? You can <em>not</em> go back. And
everything that points the way in the direction of the past but sets you
on a mission whose accomplishment can only be unreal. Such is the
justice your ever-loving Father has ensured must come to you. And from
your own unfairness to yourself has He protected you. You <em>cannot</em> lose
your way because there is no way but His and nowhere can you go except
to Him.</p>

<p><sup>39</sup> Would God allow His Son to lose his way along a road long since a
memory of time gone by? [This course will teach you only what is now.]
A dreadful instant in a distant past, now perfectly corrected, is of no
concern nor value. Let the dead and gone be peacefully forgotten.
Resurrection has come to take its place. And now you are a part of
resurrection, <em>not</em> of death. No past illusions have the power to keep
you in a place of death, a vault God’s Son entered an instant, to be
instantly restored unto His Father’s perfect Love. And how can he be
kept in chains long since removed and gone forever from his mind?</p>

<p><sup>40</sup> The Son that God created is as free as God created him. He was reborn
the instant that he chose to die instead of live. And will you not
forgive him now because he made an error in the past that God remembers
not and is not there? Now you are shifting back and forth between the
past and present. Sometimes the past seems real, as if it were the
present. Voices from the past are heard and then are doubted. You are
like to one who still hallucinates but lacks conviction in what he
perceives. This is the borderland between the worlds, the bridge between
the past and present. Here the shadow of the past remains, but still a
present light is dimly recognized. Once it is seen, this light can never
be forgotten. It must draw you from the past into the present, where you
really <em>are</em>.</p>

<p><sup>41</sup> The shadow voices do not change the laws of time or of eternity. They
come from what is past and gone and hinder not the true existence of the
here and now. The real world is the second part of the hallucination
time and death are real and have existence which can <em>be</em> perceived.
This terrible illusion was denied in but the time it took for God to
give His answer to illusion for all time and every circumstance. And
then it was no more, to be experienced as there.</p>

<p><sup>42</sup> Each day and every minute in each day and every instant that each
minute holds, you but relive the single instant when the time of terror
was replaced by love. And so you die each day to live again until you
cross the gap between past and present, which is not a gap at all. Such
is each life—a seeming interval from birth to death and on to life
again, a repetition of an instant gone by long ago, which cannot <em>be</em>
relived. And all of time is but the mad belief that what is over is
still here and now.</p>

<p><sup>43</sup> Forgive the past and let it go, for it <em>is</em> gone. You stand no longer
on the ground that lies between the worlds. You have gone on and reached
the world that lies at Heaven’s gate. There is no hindrance to the Will
of God nor any need that you repeat again a journey that was over long
ago. Look gently on each other and behold the world in which perception
of your hate has been transformed into a world of love.</p>
