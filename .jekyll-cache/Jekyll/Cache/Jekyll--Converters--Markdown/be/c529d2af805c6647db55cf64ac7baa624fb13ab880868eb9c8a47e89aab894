I"_	<p><sup>1</sup> Today let us review these ideas:</p>

<p class="review-lesson">[31] I am not the victim of the world I see.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> How can I be the victim of a world that can be completely
undone if I so choose? My chains are loosened. I can drop them off
merely by desiring to do so. The prison door is open. I can leave it
simply by walking out. Nothing holds me in this world. Only my wish to
stay keeps me a prisoner. I would give up my insane wishes and walk into
the sunlight at last.</p>

<p class="review-lesson">[32] I have invented the world I see.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> I made up the prison in which I see myself. All I need do
is recognize this, and I am free. I have deluded myself into believing
it is possible to imprison the Son of God. I was bitterly mistaken in
this belief, which I no longer want. The Son of God must be forever
free. He is as God created him, and not what I would make of him. He is
where God would have him be, and not where I thought to hold him
prisoner.</p>

<p class="review-lesson">[33] There is another way of looking at the world.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> Since the purpose of the world is not the one I ascribed to
it, there must be another way of looking at it. I see everything upside
down, and my thoughts are the opposite of truth. I see the world as a
prison for God’s Son. It must be, then, that the world is really a place
where he can be set free. I would look upon the world as it is, and see
it as a place where the Son of God finds his freedom.</p>

<p class="review-lesson">[34] I could see peace instead of this.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> When I see the world as a place of freedom, I will realize
that it reflects the laws of God instead of the rules which I made up
for it to obey. I will understand that peace, not war, abides in it. And
I will perceive that peace also abides in the hearts of all who share
this place with me.</p>

<p class="review-lesson">[35] My mind is part of God’s. I am very holy.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup> As I share the peace of the world with my brothers, I begin
to understand that this peace comes from deep within myself. The world I
look upon has taken on the light of my forgiveness and shines
forgiveness back at me. In this light, I begin to see what my illusions
about myself had kept hidden. I begin to understand the holiness of all
living things including myself, and their oneness with me.</p>
