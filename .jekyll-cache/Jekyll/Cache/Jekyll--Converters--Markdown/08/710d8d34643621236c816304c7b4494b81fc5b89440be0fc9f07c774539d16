I"<p><sup>1</sup> These are the ideas for todayâ€™s review:</p>

<p class="review-lesson">[67] Love created me like Itself.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> I am in the likeness of my Creator. I cannot suffer, I
cannot experience loss, and I cannot die. I am not a body. I would
recognize my reality today. I will worship no idols nor raise my own
self-concepts to replace my Self. I am in the likeness of my Creator.
Love created me like Itself.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> You might find these specific forms helpful in applying the
idea:</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> <em>Let me not see an illusion of myself in this.</em>  As I look
on this, let me remember my Creator.  My Creator did not create this as
I see it.</p>

<p class="review-lesson">[68] Love holds no grievances.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> Grievances are completely alien to love. Grievances attack
love and keep its light obscure. If I hold grievances I am attacking
love and therefore attacking my Self. My Self thus becomes alien to me.
I am determined not to attack my Self today, so that I can remember who
I am.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup> These specific forms for applying this idea would be
helpful:</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> <em>This is no justification for denying my Self.<br /> I will
not use this to attack love.<br /> Let this not tempt me to attack
myself</em>.</p>
