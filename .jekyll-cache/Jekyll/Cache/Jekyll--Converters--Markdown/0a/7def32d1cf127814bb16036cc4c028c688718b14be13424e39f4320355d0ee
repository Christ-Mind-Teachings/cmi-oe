I"Þ<p class="lesson-header">My home awaits me. I will hasten there.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> If I so choose, I can depart this world entirely. It is not
death which makes this possible, but it is change of mind about the
purpose of the world. If I believe it has a value as I see it now, so
will it still remain for me. But if I see no value in the world as I
behold it, nothing that I want to keep as mine or search for as a goal,
it will depart from me. For I have not sought for illusions to replace
the truth.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>Father, my home awaits my glad return. Your arms are open,
and I hear Your Voice. What need have I to linger in a place of vain
desires and of broken dreams when Heaven can so easily be mine?</em></p>
