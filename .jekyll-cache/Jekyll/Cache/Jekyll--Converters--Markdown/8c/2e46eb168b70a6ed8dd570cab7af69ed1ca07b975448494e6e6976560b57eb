I"c<p class="lesson-header">Creation’s gentleness is all I see.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> I have indeed misunderstood the world because I laid my
“sins” on it and saw them looking back at me. How fierce they seemed!
And how deceived was I to think that what I feared was in the world
instead of in my mind alone. Today I see the world in the celestial
gentleness with which creation shines. There is no fear in it. Let no
appearance of my “sins” obscure the light of Heaven, shining on the
world. What is reflected here is in God’s Mind. The images I see reflect
my thoughts. Yet is my mind at one with God’s. And so I can perceive
creation’s gentleness.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>In quiet would I look upon the world, which but reflects
Your thoughts and mine as well. Let me remember that they are the same,
and I will see creation’s gentleness.</em></p>
