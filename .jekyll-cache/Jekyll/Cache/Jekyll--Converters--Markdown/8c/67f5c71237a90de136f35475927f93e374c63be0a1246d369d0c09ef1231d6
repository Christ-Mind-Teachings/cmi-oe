I"ç<p class="lesson-header">Eternal holiness abides in me.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> My holiness is far beyond my own ability to understand or
know. Yet God my Father, Who created it, acknowledges my holiness as
His. Our will together understands it. And our will together knows that
it is so.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <em>Father, my holiness is not of me. It is not mine to be
destroyed by sin. It is not mine to suffer from attack. Illusions can
obscure it but cannot put out its radiance nor dim its light. It stands
forever perfect and untouched. In it are all things healed, for they
remain as You created them. And I can know my holiness. For Holiness
Itself created me, and I can know my Source because it is Your will that
You be known.</em></p>
