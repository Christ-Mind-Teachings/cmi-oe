I"n<p class="lesson-header">There is another way of looking at the world.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Today’s idea is an attempt to recognize that you can shift your
perception of the world in both its outer and inner aspects. A full five
minutes should be devoted to the morning and evening application.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> In these practice periods, the idea should be repeated as often as you
find profitable, though unhurried applications are essential. Alternate
between surveying your outer and inner perceptions, but without an
abrupt sense of shifting. Merely glance casually around the world you
perceive as outside yourself, then close your eyes and survey your inner
thoughts with equal casualness. Try to remain equally uninvolved in both
and to maintain this detachment as you repeat the idea throughout the
day.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> The shorter exercise periods should be as frequent as possible.
Specific applications of today’s idea should also be made immediately
when any situation arises which tempts you to become disturbed. For
these applications, say:</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> <em>There is another way of looking at this</em>. 5 Remember to apply today’s
idea the instant you are aware of distress. It may be necessary to take
a minute or so to sit quietly and repeat the idea to yourself several
times. Closing your eyes will probably help in this form of application.</p>
