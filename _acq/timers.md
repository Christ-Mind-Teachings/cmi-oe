title: Timers Needed
---

<h2 class="ui header">
Help Wanted!
</h2>

Many teachings in the Library include audio. A <i class="volume up
icon"></i> icon appears in the menu bar when audio is available.
Clicking the icon will display the audio player. Clicking it again will
hide the player.

When listening, the paragraph in the text corresponding to the audio is
highlighted and scrolled automatically. This makes it easy to listen and
read along without loosing your place.

This feature depends on timing data that is collected by a timer who
listens to the audio and records paragraph transitions as the audio
plays from beginning to the end.

When the audio finishes the data collected is sent to Rick by pressing
the 'Submit' button.

This is what we need help with. It's an easy job and one you'll likely
find to be rewarding.

Read on for more information.

What is a Timer?
</h2>

A timer uses a feature of the site to capture timing data. Timing data
is used to synchronize audio with content such that the paragraph
currently spoken is highlighted and scrolled into view.

Timing data is captured by clicking a large <i class="bullseye
icon"></i> icon in the gap between the end of the previous paragraph and
the start of the paragraph with the bullseye icon.

I know that doesn't sound particularly clear so read below for a clearer
description.

To enable capture of timing data you must create an account on the site
and let me know you want to volunteer. I'll make a change to your
account so capture mode is available to you. You can request chapters or
lessons that you want to capture timing data for or I will assign some
if you don't have a preference.

Instructions
</h2>

1.  Create an account

    Follow instructions for creating an account <a href="/acq/accounts/#create-an-account" target="_blank">here.</a>

2.  Contact Rick

    Use the <a href="/acq/contact/" target="_blank">contact form</a> to let
    me know you'd like to support the project by being a timer and let me
    know if you have a preference of what you'd like to work on. I'll get
    you set up and answer any questions before you dive in.

3.  How to identify what needs timing data

    Open the Table of Contents for the *Text*, *Workbook*, or *Manual*.
    Items that have timing data are preceded by a clock (ðŸ•™) and items
    that are assigned but don't yet have timing data are preceded by a
    person outline (ðŸ‘¤).

    Those items that are not preceded by an icon need to have timing data
    collected.

4.  How to collect timing data

    Use the Table of Contents to open a page you will collect timing data
    for. Press the <i class="volume up icon"></i> icon to open the audio
    player.

    Click the big 'C' on the audio player. This will display bullseye
    icons in front of every paragraph with the first one checked. Click
    it again to hide the icons.

    <img class="ui big image" src="/t/acimoe/public/img/capture/capture-C.png">

    To start collecting data, press the play button on the audio player.
    The audio will begin with the first paragraph, the one that is
    checked. 

    The idea is to click the bullseye on the next paragraph when the
    audio has completed speaking the checked paragraph and before it
    begins the next. To click the bullseye in the gap between
    paragraphs.

    It's best to click the icon soon after the previous paragraph has
    finished. Don't try to guess where the middle of the gap is.

    If you mess up, it's easy to fix. When you click the bullseye it
    turns into a check and will turn back to a bullseye if you click it
    again. 

    You can skip the audio back or forward 15 seconds by pressing the
    controls on the player. You can pause if you need a break. Play with
    it and it won't be long before you feel comfortable.

5.  In most cases the audio will play music for 30 seconds or longer
    after the text has been read completely and you may not want to wait
    for it to finish before submitting the data. You can speed up the
    process by increasing the playback speed to 2x.

6.  Submit the data

    When the audio has finished a form will be displayed. There is a
    place where you can enter comments before sending the data to me.
    Please let me know if you discovered problems or had any issues. No
    need to add anything if not.

    <img class="ui big image" src="/t/acimoe/public/img/capture/capture-submit.png">

    Press the "Submit" button to send the data. After a few seconds you
    should see a "Thank You" message at the upper right of the screen.

Conclusion

That's all there is to it.

Thank you very much for considering to volunteer. Your help is a great
time saver.
