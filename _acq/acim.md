          The Text volume of the <em>Original Edition</em> has undergone an evolutionary
          process since the 1972 manuscript of <em>A Course in Miracles</em> was
          discovered and released on the internet in late 1999. In early 2000,
          Course in Miracles Society (CIMS) printed the 1972 manuscript of the
          Text only, entitled: <em>Jesus' Course in Miracles</em>. Distribution of that
          book was suspended during the continuance of the copyright litigation,
          which was concluded in 2006.

          In November 2006 the initial printing of <em>A Course in Miracles</em> ~
          <em>Original Edition</em>, containing the Text, Workbook for Students, and
          Manual for Teachers, was released. The 2006 Printing corrected numerous
          typographic errors, misspellings, and aberrant punctuation that had
          appeared in the original 1972 manuscript and which were reproduced in
          the <em>Jesus' Course in Miracles</em> edition.

          There was a second printing in 2009 which continued the process of
          correcting errors in the manuscript. In this undertaking, the editors
          for the first time looked back to earlier manuscripts and restored
          material that appeared to have been inadvertently or mistakenly omitted
          in retyping. This process of restoration has continued through the 2012,
          2017, and 2018 Printings, adhering always to the fundamental directive,
          "fidelity to Source."

In its continuing evolution, this *Original Edition* faithfully reproduces
the original transcript of the book that was the result of the
collaboration between Schucman and Thetford, whom many believe were
involved with each other in the "holy relationship" described in
Chapters 17 through 22 of the Text.

This edition preserves the original language of the dictation of those
chapters, which were addressed to the two collaborators as they worked
together to produce the manuscript. Later editing of the manuscript
changed the focus of these important chapters and addresses them to a
solitary reader, removing the mutuality that is explicit in the original
dictation.

When encountering Schucman and Thetford's Original Edition, students
often find fresh clarity as they read its wording or new understanding
as they encounter passages that were not included in the later 1975
edition. In the case of editing, it seems to us that the "less-is-best"
rule appliesâ€”the less tampering with the eloquent and carefully worded
dictation that Schucman received, the better. Also, much of the
dictation came through in iambic pentameter&mdash;a particular literary
cadence&mdash;and was beautifully preserved in this edition.
