<sup>44</sup> You must have noticed how often I have used your own ideas to help
you. You have learned to be a loving, wise, and very understanding
therapist *except for yourself*. That exception has given you more than
perception for others because of what you saw in *them* but *less* than
knowledge of your real relationships *to* them, because you did not
accept them as *part* of you. Understanding *is* beyond perception
because it introduces meaning. It is, however, below knowledge even
though it can grow *towards* it. It is possible, with great effort, to
understand someone else to some extent and to be quite helpful to him,
but the effort is misdirected. The misdirection is quite apparent; it is
directed away from *you*.

<sup>45</sup> This does not mean that it is *lost* to you, but it *does* mean that
you are not aware of it. I have saved all your kindnesses and every
loving thought you have had. I have purified them of the errors which
hid their light and have kept them for you in their own perfect
radiance. They are beyond destruction and beyond guilt. They came from
the Holy Spirit within *you*, and we know what God creates is eternal.
What fear has hidden still is part of you.

<sup>46</sup> Joining the Atonement, which I have repeatedly asked you to do, is
always a way *out* of fear. This does not mean that you can safely fail
to acknowledge anything that is true. However, the Holy Spirit will not
fail to help you reinterpret everything that you perceive as fearful and
teach you that *only* what is loving *is* true. Truth is beyond your
ability to destroy but entirely within your grasp. It belongs to you
because you created it. It is yours because it is a part of you, just as
you are part of God because He created *you*.

<sup>47</sup> The Atonement is the *guarantee* of the safety of the Kingdom.
Nothing good is lost because it comes from the Holy Spirit, the Voice
for creation. Nothing that is *not* good was ever created and therefore
*cannot* be protected. What the ego makes, it *keeps to itself*, and so
it is without strength. Its unshared existence does not die; it was
merely never born. Real birth is not a beginning; it is a *continuing*.
Everything that can continue has *been* born, but it can *increase* as
you are willing to return the part of your mind that needs healing to
the higher part and thus render your creating undivided.

<sup>48</sup> As a therapist, you yourself tell your patients that the real
difference between neurotic and “healthy” guilt feelings is that
neurotic guilt feelings *do not help anyone*. This distinction is wise
though incomplete. Let us make the distinction a little sharper now.
Neurotic guilt feelings are a device of the ego for “atoning” without
sharing and for asking pardon without change. The ego *never* calls for
*real* Atonement and cannot tolerate forgiveness, which *is* change.

<sup>49</sup> Your concept of “healthy guilt feelings” has merit, but without the
concept of the Atonement, it lacks the healing potential it holds. You
made the distinction in terms of feelings, which led to a decision not
to *repeat* the error, which is only *part* of healing. Your concept
lacked the idea of *undoing* it. What you were really advocating, then,
was adopting a policy of sharing without a real *foundation*. I have
come to *give* you the foundation, so your own thoughts can make you
*really* free. You have carried the burden of the ideas you did not
share and which were therefore too weak to increase, but you did not
recognize how to undo their existence *because* you had made them.

<sup>50</sup> You *cannot* cancel out your past errors alone. They will *not*
disappear from your mind without remedy. The remedy is *not* of your
making, any more than *you* are. The Atonement cannot be understood
except as a *pure act of sharing*. That is what is meant when we said it
is possible even in this world to listen to *one* voice. If you are part
of God and the Sonship is one, you *cannot* be limited to the “self” the
ego sees. Every loving thought held in *any* part of the Sonship belongs
to every part. It is shared *because* it is loving. Sharing is God's way
of creating and also *yours*. Your ego can keep you in exile *from* the
Kingdom, but in the Kingdom itself it has no power.

<sup>51</sup> You have become willing to receive my messages as I give them without
interference by the ego, so we can clarify an earlier point. We said
that you will one day teach as much as you learn and that will keep you
in balance. The time is now because you have *let* it be now. You cannot
learn *except* by teaching.

<sup>52</sup> I heard one voice because I had learned that learning is attained
*by* teaching. I understood that *I could not atone for myself alone*.
Listening to one voice means the will to *share* the voice in order to
hear it yourself. The mind that was in me is still irresistibly drawn to
every mind created by God, because God's Wholeness *is* the wholeness of
His Son.

<sup>53</sup> Turning the other cheek does *not* mean that you should submit to
violence without protest. It means that you cannot *be* hurt and do not
want to show your brother anything *except* your wholeness. Show him
that he *cannot* hurt you and hold nothing against him, or you hold it
against yourself. Teaching is done in many ways: by formal means, by
guidance, and above all *by example*. Teaching is therapy, because it
means the *sharing* of ideas and the awareness that to share them is to
*strengthen* them. The union of the Sonship *is* its protection. The ego
cannot prevail against the Kingdom *because* it is united, and the ego
fades away and is undone in the presence of the attraction of the parts
of the Sonship, which hear the call of the Holy Spirit to be as One.

<sup>54</sup> I cannot forget my need to teach what I have learned, which arose in
me *because* I learned it. I call upon you to teach what you have
learned, because by so doing *you* can depend on it. Make it dependable
in my name, because my name is the name of God's Son. What I learned I
give you freely, and the mind which was in me rejoices as *you* choose
to hear it. The Holy Spirit atones in all of us by *undoing* and thus
lifts the burden you have placed in your mind. By following Him, He
leads you back to God where you belong, and how can you find this way
except by taking your brother with you?

<sup>55</sup> My part in the Atonement is not complete until *you* join it and give
it away. As you teach, so shall you learn. I will never leave you or
forsake you, because to forsake you would be to forsake myself and God
who created me. You will forsake yourselves and God if you forsake *any*
of your brothers. You are more than your brother's keeper. In fact, you
do not *want* to keep him. You must learn to see him as he is and *know*
that he belongs to God as you do. How could you treat your brother
better than by rendering unto God the things which are God's?

<sup>56</sup> Ideas do not *leave* the mind which thought them to have a separate
being, nor do separate thoughts conflict with one another in space,
because they do not occupy space at all. However, human ideas *can*
conflict in content, because they occur at different levels and include
opposite thoughts at the *same* level. *It is impossible to share
opposing thoughts*. The Holy Spirit does not *let* you forsake your
brothers. Therefore, you can really share *only* the parts of your
thoughts which are of Him and which He also keeps for *you*. And of such
is the Kingdom of Heaven. All the rest remains with you until He has
reinterpreted them in the light of the Kingdom, making them, too, worthy
of being shared. When they have been sufficiently purified, He lets you
give them away. The will to share them *is* their purification.

<sup>57</sup> The Atonement gives you the power of a healed mind, but the power to
create is of God. Therefore, those who have been forgiven must devote
themselves first to healing, because having *received* the idea of
healing, they must *give* it to *hold* it. The full power of creation
cannot be expressed as long as *any* of God's ideas withhold it from the
Kingdom. The joint will of *all* the Sonship is the only creator that
can create like the Father, because only the complete can think
completely, and the thinking of God lacks nothing. Everything you think
that is not through the Holy Spirit *is* lacking.

<sup>58</sup> How can you who are so holy suffer? All your past except its beauty
is gone, and nothing is left except a blessing. You can indeed depart in
peace, because I have loved you as I loved myself. You go *with* my
blessing and *for* my blessing. Hold it and share it, that it may always
be ours. I place the peace of God in your heart and in your hands, to
hold and share. The heart is pure to hold it and the hands are strong to
give it. We cannot lose. My judgment is as strong as the wisdom of God,
in Whose heart and hands we have our being. His quiet Children are His
blessed Sons. The thoughts of God are with you.
