<sup>20</sup> It is possible even in this world to hear *only* that Voice and no
other. It takes effort and great willingness to learn. It is the final
lesson that I learned, and God's Sons are as equal as learners as they
are as Souls. The Voice of the Holy Spirit *is* the call to Atonement or
the restoration of the integrity of the mind. When the Atonement is
complete and the whole Sonship is healed, there will be no call to
return, but what God creates is eternal. The Holy Spirit will remain
with the Sons of God to bless *their* creations and keep them in the
light of joy.

<sup>21</sup> You *are* the Kingdom of Heaven, but you have let the belief in
darkness enter your minds, and so you need a new light. The Holy Spirit
is the radiance that you must let banish the idea of darkness. His is
the glory before which dissociation falls away and the Kingdom of Heaven
breaks through into its own. Before the separation you did not need
guidance. You *knew* as you will know again, but as you do *not* know
now. God does not guide because He can share only perfect knowledge.
Guidance is evaluative, because it implies that there is a *right* way
and also a *wrong* way, one to be chosen and the other to be avoided. By
choosing one, you give up the other.

<sup>22</sup> This *is* a conflict state. It *means* that knowledge has been lost,
because knowledge is sure. God is not in you in a literal sense; *you*
are part of *Him*. When you chose to leave Him, He gave you a Voice to
speak *for* Him because He could no longer share His knowledge with you
without hindrance. Direct communication was broken because you had made
another voice through another will. The Holy Spirit calls you both to
remember and to forget. You have chosen to be in a state of opposition
in which opposites are possible. As a result, there *are* choices which
you must make. In the holy state, the will is free in the sense that its
*creative* power is unlimited, but choice itself is meaningless.

<sup>23</sup> Freedom to choose is the same *power* as freedom to create, but its
*application* is different. Choosing *means* divided will. The Holy
Spirit is one way of choosing. This way is in you because there is also
*another* way. God did not leave His Children comfortless, even though
they chose to leave Him. The voice they put in their minds was *not* the
voice of His Will for which the Holy Spirit speaks. The call to return
is stronger than the call to depart, but it speaks in a different way.

<sup>24</sup> The Voice of the Holy Spirit does not command, because it is
incapable of arrogance. It does not demand, because it does not seek
control. It does not overcome, because it does not attack. It merely
*reminds*. It is compelling only because of what it reminds you *of*. It
brings to your mind the *other* way, remaining quiet even in the midst
of the turmoil you have made for yourselves. The Voice for God is always
quiet, because it speaks of peace. Yet peace is stronger than war
because it heals. War is division, not increase. No one gains from
strife.

<sup>25</sup> “What profiteth it a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own
Soul?” That means that if he listens to the wrong voice, he has *lost
sight* of his Soul. He *cannot* lose it, but he *can* not know it. It is
therefore *lost to him* until he chooses right. The Holy Spirit is your
Guide in choosing. He is the part of your mind which *always* speaks for
the right choice because He speaks for God. He is your remaining
communication with God, which you can interrupt but cannot destroy.

<sup>26</sup> The Holy Spirit is the way in which God's Will can be done on earth
as it is in Heaven. Both Heaven and earth are in *you*, because the call
of both is in your will and therefore in your mind. The Voice for God
comes from your own altars to Him. These altars are not things; they are
*devotions*. Yet you have other devotions now. Your divided devotion has
given you the two voices, and you must choose at which altar you will to
serve. The call you answer now is an evaluation because it is a
*decision*. The decision itself is very simple. It is made on the basis
of which call is worth more to you.

<sup>27</sup> My mind will always be like yours, because we were created as equals.
It was only my *decision* that gave me all power in Heaven and earth. My
only gift to you is to help you make the same decision *for yourself*.
The will for this decision is the will to *share* it, because the
decision itself *is* the decision to share. It is *made by giving* and
is therefore the *one* act of mind that resembles true creation. You
understand the role of “models” in the learning process and the
importance of the models you value and choose to follow in determining
what you will to learn. I am your model for decision. By deciding for
God, I showed you that this decision *can* be made and that *you* can
make it.

<sup>28</sup> I promised you that the mind that made the decision for me is also in
*you* and that you can let it change you just as it changed me. This
mind is unequivocal, because it hears only *one* voice and answers in
only *one* way. You are the light of the world with me. Rest does not
come from sleeping but from waking. The Holy Spirit is the call to awake
and be glad. The world is very tired, because it *is* the idea of
weariness. Our task is the joyous one of waking it to the Call for God.
Everyone will answer the Call of the Holy Spirit, or the Sonship cannot
be as one. What better vocation could there be for any part of the
Kingdom than to restore it to the perfect integration that can make it
whole?

<sup>29</sup> Hear only this through the Holy Spirit within you, and teach your
brothers to listen as I am teaching you. When you are tempted by the
wrong voice, call on me to remind you how to heal by sharing my decision
*and making it stronger*. As we share this goal we increase its power to
attract the whole Sonship and to bring it back into the Oneness in which
it was created. Remember that “yoke” means “join together” and “burden”
means “message.” Let us reconsider the Biblical statement, “My yoke is
easy and my burden light” in this way: “Let us join together, for my
message is light.”

<sup>30</sup> I came into your minds because you had grown vaguely aware of the
fact that there *is* another way or another Voice. Having given this
invitation to the Holy Spirit, I could come to provide the model for
*how to think*. Psychology has become the study of *behavior*, but no
one denies the basic law that behavior is a response to *motivation*,
and motivation is will. I have enjoined you to behave as I behaved, but
we must respond to the same mind to do this. This mind is the Holy
Spirit, whose will is for God always. He teaches you how to keep me as
the model for your thought and to behave like me as a result.

<sup>31</sup> The power of our joint motivation is beyond belief but *not* beyond
accomplishment. What we can accomplish together *has* no limits, because
the Call for God *is* the call to the unlimited. Child of God, my
message is for *you* to hear and give away as you answer the Holy Spirit
within you.
