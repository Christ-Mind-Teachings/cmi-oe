<sup>11</sup> Fear is a symptom of your deep sense of loss. If when you perceive it
in others you learn to *supply* the loss, the basic *cause* of fear is
removed. Thereby you teach yourself that fear does not exist *in you*,
for you have *in yourself* the means for removing it and have
demonstrated this by *giving* it. Fear and love are the only emotions of
which you are capable. One is false, for it was made out of denial, and
denial depends on the real belief in what is denied for its *own*
existence.

<sup>12</sup> By interpreting fear correctly *as a positive affirmation of the
underlying belief it masks*, you are undermining its perceived
usefulness by rendering it useless. Defenses which do not work at all
are *automatically* discarded. If you raise what fear conceals to
*clear-cut, unequivocal predominance*, fear becomes meaningless. You
have denied its power to conceal love, which was its only purpose. The
mask which *you* have drawn across the face of love has disappeared.

<sup>13</sup> If you would look upon love, which *is* the world's reality, how
could you do better than to recognize in every defense *against* it the
underlying appeal *for* it? And how could you better learn of its
reality than by answering the appeal for it by *giving* it? The Holy
Spirit's interpretation of fear *does* dispel it, for the *awareness* of
truth cannot *be* denied. Thus does the Holy Spirit replace fear with
love and translate error into truth. And thus will *you* learn of Him
how to replace your dream of separation with the fact of unity. For the
separation is only the *denial* of union and, correctly interpreted,
attests to your eternal knowledge that union is true.

<sup>14</sup> Miracles are merely the translation of denial into truth. If to love
oneself is to *heal* oneself, those who are sick do *not* love
themselves. Therefore, they are asking for the love that would heal them
but which they are denying to themselves. If they knew the truth about
themselves, they could not *be* sick. The task of the miracle-worker
thus becomes *to deny the denial of truth*. The sick must heal
*themselves*, for the truth is in them. Yet, having *obscured* it, the
light in *another* mind must shine into theirs because that light *is*
theirs.

<sup>15</sup> The light in them shines as brightly, *regardless* of the density of
the fog that obscures it. If *you* give no power to the fog to obscure
the light, it *has* none, for it has power only because the Son of God
gave power to it. He must *himself* withdraw that power, remembering
that *all* power is of God. *You can remember this for all the Sonship*.
Do not allow your brother not to remember, for his forgetfulness is
*yours.* But *your* remembering is *his*, for God cannot be remembered
alone. *This is what you have forgotten*. To perceive the healing of
your brother as the healing of yourself is thus the way to remember God.
For you forgot your brothers *with* Him, and God's answer to your
forgetting is but the way to remember.

<sup>16</sup> Perceive in sickness but another call for love and offer your brother
what he believes he cannot offer himself. Whatever the sickness, there
is but *one* remedy. You will be made whole as you *make* whole, for to
perceive in sickness the appeal for health is to recognize in hatred the
call for love. And to give a brother what he *really* wants is to offer
it unto yourself, for your Father wills you to know your brother *as*
yourself. Answer *his* call for love and *yours* is answered. Healing is
the love of Christ for His Father and for *Himself.*

<sup>17</sup> Remember what we said about the frightening perceptions of little
children which terrify them because they do not understand them. If they
ask for enlightenment and *accept* it, their fears vanish, but if they
*hide* their nightmares, they will *keep* them. It is easy to help an
uncertain child, for he recognizes that he does not know what his
perceptions mean. Yet you believe that you *do* know. Little children,
you are hiding your heads under the covers of the heavy blankets you
have laid upon yourselves. You are hiding your nightmares in the
darkness of your own certainty and refusing to open your eyes *and look
at them.*

<sup>18</sup> Let us not save nightmares, for they are not fitting offerings for
Christ, and so they are not fit gifts for *you*. Take off the covers and
look at what you are afraid of. Only the *anticipation* will frighten
you, for the reality of nothingness cannot *be* frightening. Let us not
delay this, for your dream of hatred will not leave you without help,
and help is here. Learn to be quiet in the midst of turmoil, for
quietness is the end of strife and this is the journey to peace. Look
straight at every image that rises to delay you, for the goal is
inevitable because it is eternal. The goal of love is but your right,
and it belongs to you *despite* your preference.

<sup>19</sup> *You still want what God wills*, and no nightmare can defeat a Child
of God in his purpose. For your purpose was given you by God, and you
must accomplish it *because* it is His Will. Awake and remember your
purpose, for it is *your* will to do so. What has been accomplished for
you *must* be yours. Do not let your hatred stand in the way of love,
for *nothing* can withstand the love of Christ for His Father or His
Father's love for Him.

<sup>20</sup> A little while and you *will* see me, for I am not hidden because
*you* are hiding. I will awaken you as surely as I awakened myself, for
I awoke *for* you. In *my* resurrection is *your* release. Our mission
is to escape *crucifixion*, not redemption. Trust in my help, for I did
not walk alone, and I will walk with you as our Father walked with me.
Did you not know that I walked with Him in peace? And does not that mean
that peace goes with *us* on the journey?

<sup>21</sup> There is no fear in perfect love. We will but be making perfect to
you what is *already* perfect *in* you. You do not fear the *unknown*,
but the *known.* You will not fail in your mission because I failed not
in mine. Give me but a little trust in the name of the *complete* trust
I have in you, and we will easily accomplish the goal of perfection
together. For perfection *is* and cannot *be* denied. To deny the denial
of perfection is not so difficult as the denial of truth, and what we
can accomplish together *must* be believed when you *see* it as
accomplished.

<sup>22</sup> You who have tried to banish love have not succeeded, but you who
choose to banish fear *will* succeed. The Lord is with you, but you know
it not. Yet your Redeemer liveth and abideth in you in the peace out of
which He was created. Would you not exchange *this* awareness for the
awareness of your fear? When we have overcome fear—not by hiding it, not
by minimizing it, not by denying its full import in any way—this *is*
what you will really see. You cannot lay aside the obstacle to real
vision without looking upon it, for to lay aside means to judge
*against*. If *you* will look, the Holy Spirit will judge and will judge
truly. He cannot shine away what *you* keep hidden, for you have not
offered it to Him, and He cannot take it *from* you.

<sup>23</sup> We are therefore embarking on an organized, well-structured, and
carefully planned program aimed at learning how to offer to the Holy
Spirit everything you do *not* want. *He* knows what to do with it. You
do *not* know how to use what He knows. Whatever is revealed to Him that
is not of God is gone. Yet you must reveal it to *yourself* in perfect
willingness, for otherwise His knowledge remains useless to you. Surely
He will not fail to help you, since help is His *only* purpose. Do you
not have greater reason for fearing the world as *you* perceive it than
for looking at the cause of fear and letting it go forever?
