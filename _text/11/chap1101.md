You have been told not to make error real, and the way to do this is
very simple. If you *want* to believe in error, you would *have* to make
it real because it is not true. But truth is real in its own right, and
to believe in truth, *you do not have to do anything*. Understand that
you do not respond to stimuli, but to stimuli *as you interpret them.*
Your interpretation thus becomes the justification for the response.
That is why analyzing the motives of others is hazardous to *you*. If
you decide that someone is really trying to attack you or desert you or
enslave you, you will respond *as if* he had actually done so, because
you have made his error *real* to you. To interpret error is to give it
power, and having done this, you *will* overlook truth.

<sup>2</sup> The analysis of ego-motivation is very complicated, very obscuring,
and *never* without the risk of your own ego-involvement. The whole
process represents a clear-cut attempt to demonstrate your *own* ability
to understand what you perceive. This is shown by the fact that you
react to your interpretations *as if* they were correct and control your
reactions behaviorally but not emotionally. This is quite evidently a
mental split in which you have attacked the integrity of your mind and
pitted one level within it against another.
