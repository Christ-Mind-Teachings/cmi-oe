<sup>28</sup> What waits in perfect certainty beyond salvation is not our concern.
For you have barely started to allow your first uncertain steps to be
directed up the ladder separation led you down. The miracle alone is
your concern at present. Here is where we must begin. And having
started, will the way be made serene and simple in the rising up to
waking and the ending of the dream. When you accept a miracle, you do
not add your dream of fear to one that is already being dreamed. Without
support, the dream will fade away without effects. For it is *your*
support that strengthens it.

<sup>29</sup> No mind is sick until another mind agrees that they are separate. And
thus it is their *joint* decision to be sick. If you withhold agreement
and accept the part *you* play in making sickness real, the other mind
cannot project its guilt without your aid in letting it perceive itself
as separate and apart from you. Thus is the body not perceived as sick
by both your minds, from separate points of view. Uniting with a
brother's mind prevents the *cause* of sickness and perceived effects.
Healing is the effect of minds which join, as sickness comes from minds
which separate.

<sup>30</sup> The miracle does nothing just *because* the minds are joined and
cannot separate. Yet in the dreaming has this been reversed, and
separate minds are seen as bodies which are separated and which cannot
join. Do not allow your brother to be sick, for if he is, have you
abandoned him to his own dream by sharing it with him. He has not seen
the cause of sickness where it is, and you have overlooked the gap
between you, where the sickness has been bred. Thus are you *joined* in
sickness, to preserve the little gap unhealed, where sickness is kept
carefully protected, cherished, and upheld by firm belief, lest God
should come to bridge the little gap that leads to Him. Fight not His
coming with illusions, for it is His coming that you want above all
things that seem to glisten in the dream.

<sup>31</sup> The end of dreaming is the end of fear, and love was never in the
world of dreams. The gap *is* little. Yet it holds the seeds of
pestilence and every form of ill because it is a wish to keep apart and
not to join. And thus it seems to give a cause to sickness which is
*not* its cause. The *purpose* of the gap is all the cause that sickness
has. For it was made to keep you separated in a body which you see as if
*it* were the cause of pain.

<sup>32</sup> The cause of pain is separation, not the body, which is only its
effect. Yet separation is but empty space, enclosing nothing, doing
nothing, and as unsubstantial as the empty place between the ripples
that a ship has made in passing by. And covered just as fast, as water
rushes in to close the gap and as the waves in joining cover it. Where
is the gap between the waves when they have joined and covered up the
space which seemed to keep them separate for a little while? Where are
the grounds for sickness when the minds have joined to close the little
gap between them where the seeds of sickness seemed to grow?

<sup>33</sup> God builds the bridge, but only in the space left clean and vacant by
the miracle. The seeds of sickness and the shame of \[sin\] He cannot
bridge, for He cannot destroy the alien will that He created not. Let
its effects be gone and clutch them not with eager hands, to keep them
for yourself. The miracle will brush them all aside and thus make room
for Him Who wills to come and bridge His Son's returning to Himself.

<sup>34</sup> Count, then, the silver miracles and golden dreams of happiness as
all the treasures you would keep within the storehouse of the world. The
door is open, not to thieves but to your starving brothers who mistook
for gold the shining of a pebble and who stored a heap of snow that
shone like silver. They have nothing left behind the open door. What is
the world except a little gap perceived to tear eternity apart and break
it into days and months and years? And what are you who live within the
world except a picture of the Son of God in broken pieces, each
concealed within a separate and uncertain bit of clay?

<sup>35</sup> Be not afraid, but let your world be lit by miracles. And where the
gap was seen to stand between you, join your brother there. And sickness
will be seen *without* a cause. The dream of healing in forgiveness lies
and gently shows you that you never sinned. The miracle would leave no
proof of guilt to bring you witness to what never was. And in your
storehouse it will make a place of welcome for your Father and your
Self. The door is open that all those may come who would no longer
starve and would enjoy the feast of plenty set before them there. And
they will meet with your invited Guests the miracle has asked to come to
you.

<sup>36</sup> This is a feast unlike indeed to those the dreaming of the world has
shown. For here, the more that anyone receives, the more is left for all
the rest to share. The Guests have brought unlimited supply with Them.
And no one is deprived or can deprive. Here is a feast the Father lays
before His Son and shares it equally with him. And in Their sharing
there can *be* no gap in which abundance falters and grows thin. Here
can the lean years enter not, for time waits not upon this feast, which
has no end. For Love has set Its table in the space that seemed to keep
your Guests apart from you.
