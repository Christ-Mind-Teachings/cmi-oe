<sup>47</sup> This is a course in miracles. And as such, the laws of healing must
be understood before the purpose of the course can be accomplished. Let
us review the principles that we have covered and arrange them in a way
that summarizes all that must occur for healing to be possible. For when
it once is possible, it *must* occur. All sickness comes from
separation. When the separation is denied, it goes. For it *is* gone as
soon as the idea which brought it has been healed and been replaced by
sanity. Sickness and sin are seen as consequence and cause in a
relationship kept hidden from awareness that it may be carefully
preserved from reason's light.

<sup>48</sup> Guilt *asks* for punishment, and its request is granted—not in truth
but in the world of shadows and illusions built on sin. The Son of God
perceives what he would see, because perception *is* a wish fulfilled.
Perception changes, made to take the place of changeless knowledge. Yet
is truth unchanged. It cannot be perceived, but only known. What is
perceived takes many forms, but none has meaning. Brought to truth, its
senselessness is quite apparent. Kept apart from truth, it seems to have
a meaning and be real.

<sup>49</sup> Perception's laws are opposite to truth, and what is true of
knowledge is not true of anything that is apart from it. Yet has God
given answer to the world of sickness which applies to *all* its forms.
God's answer is eternal, though it operates in time where it is needed.
Yet because it *is* of God, the laws of time do not affect its workings.
It is in this world, but not a part of it. For it is real and dwells
where all reality must be. Ideas leave not their source, and their
effects but seem to be apart from them. Ideas are of the mind. What is
projected out and seems to be external to the mind is not outside at all
but an effect of what is in and has not left its source.

<sup>50</sup> God's answer lies where the belief in sin must be, for only there can
its effects be utterly undone and without cause. Perception's laws must
be reversed, because they *are* reversals of the laws of truth. The laws
of truth forever will be true and cannot *be* reversed, yet can be
*seen* as upside-down. And this must be corrected where the illusion of
reversal lies.

<sup>51</sup> It is impossible that one illusion be less amenable to truth than are
the rest. But it *is* possible that some are given greater value and
less willingly offered to truth for healing and for help. No illusion
has any truth in it. Yet it appears some are more true than others,
although this clearly makes no sense at all. All that a hierarchy of
illusions can show is preference, not reality. What relevance has
preference to the truth? Illusions are illusions and are false. Your
preference gives them no reality. Not one is true in any way, and all
must yield with equal ease to what God gave as answer to them all. God's
Will is One. And any wish that seems to go against His Will has *no*
foundation in the truth.

<sup>52</sup> Sin is not error, for it goes beyond correction to impossibility. Yet
the belief that it is real has made some errors seem forever past the
hope of healing and the lasting grounds for hell. If this were so, would
Heaven be opposed by its own opposite, as real as it. Then would God's
Will be split in two and all creation be subjected to the laws of two
opposing powers until God becomes impatient, splits the world apart, and
relegates attack unto Himself. Thus has He lost His Mind, proclaiming
sin has taken His reality from Him, and brought His love at last to
vengeance's heels. For such an insane picture, an insane defense can be
expected but can *not* establish that the picture must be true.

<sup>53</sup> Nothing gives meaning where no meaning is. And truth *needs* no
defense to make it true. Illusions have no witnesses and no effects. Who
looks on them is but deceived. Forgiveness is the only function here and
serves to bring the joy this world denies to every aspect of God's Son
where sin was thought to rule. Perhaps you do not see the role
forgiveness plays in ending death and all beliefs that rise from mists
of guilt.

<sup>54</sup> Sins are beliefs which you impose between your brother and yourself.
They limit you to time and place and give a little space to you, another
little space to him. This separating off is symbolized in your
perception by a body which is clearly separate and a thing apart. Yet
what this symbol represents is but your wish to *be* apart and separate.
Forgiveness takes *away* what stands between your brother and yourself.
It is the wish that you be joined with him and *not* apart. We call it
“wish” because it still conceives of other choices and has not yet
reached beyond the world of choice entirely.

<sup>55</sup> Yet is this wish in line with Heaven's state and not in opposition to
God's Will. Although it falls far short of giving you your full
inheritance, it *does* remove the obstacles which you have placed
between the Heaven where you are and recognition of where and what you
are. Facts are unchanged. Yet facts can be denied and thus unknown,
though they were known *before* they were denied.

<sup>56</sup> Salvation, perfect and complete, asks but a little wish that what is
true be true; a little willingness to overlook what is not there; a
little sigh that speaks for Heaven as a preference to this world which
death and desolation seem to rule. In joyous answer will creation rise
within you to replace the world you see with Heaven, wholly perfect and
complete. What is forgiveness but a willingness that truth be true? What
can remain unhealed and broken from a Unity Which holds all things
within Itself? There *is* no sin. And every miracle is possible the
instant that the Son of God perceives his wishes and the Will of God are
one.

<sup>57</sup> What is the Will of God? He wills His Son have everything. And this
He guaranteed when He created him *as* everything. It is impossible that
anything be lost if what you *have* is what you *are*. This is the
miracle by which creation became your function, sharing it with God. It
is not understood apart from Him and therefore has no meaning in this
world.

<sup>58</sup> Here does the Son of God ask not too much but far too little. He
would sacrifice his own identity with everything to find a little
treasure of his own. And this he cannot do without a sense of isolation,
loss, and loneliness. This is the treasure he has sought to find. And he
could only be afraid of it. Is fear a treasure? Can uncertainty be what
you *want*? Or is it a mistake about your will and what you *really*
are? Let us consider what the error is, so it can be corrected, not
protected.

<sup>59</sup> Sin is belief attack can be projected outside the mind where the
belief arose. Here is the firm conviction that ideas *can* leave their
source made real and meaningful. And from this error does the world of
sin and sacrifice arise. This world is an attempt to prove your
innocence while cherishing attack. Its failure lies in that you *still*
feel guilty, though without understanding *why*. Effects are seen as
separate from their source and seem to be beyond you to control or to
prevent. What is thus *kept* apart can never join.

<sup>60</sup> Cause and effect are one, not separate. God wills you learn what
always has been true—that He created you as part of Him, and this must
still be true *because* ideas leave not their source. Such is creation's
law—that each idea the mind conceives but *adds* to its abundance,
*never* takes away. This is as true of what is idly wished as what is
truly willed, because the mind can wish to be deceived but cannot make
it be what it is not. And to believe ideas can leave their source is to
invite illusions to be true, *without success*. For never will success
be possible in trying to deceive the Son of God.

<sup>61</sup> The miracle is possible when cause and consequence are brought
together, not kept separate. The healing of effect without the cause can
merely shift effects to other forms. And this is *not* release. God's
Son could never be content with less than full salvation and escape from
guilt. For otherwise he still demands that he must make some sacrifice
and thus denies that everything is his, unlimited by loss of any kind. A
tiny sacrifice is just the same in its effects as is the whole idea of
sacrifice. If loss in any form is possible, then is God's Son made
incomplete and not himself. \[Nor will he know himself nor recognize his
will.\] He has forsworn his Father *and* himself and made them both his
enemies in hate.

<sup>62</sup> Illusions serve the purpose they were made to serve. And from their
purpose, they derive whatever meaning that they seem to have. God gave
to all illusions that were made *another* purpose that would justify a
miracle, whatever form they took. In every miracle all healing lies, for
God gave answer to them all as one. And what is one to Him must be the
same. If you believe what is the same is different, you but deceive
yourself. What God calls one will be forever one, not separate. His
Kingdom *is* united—thus it was created, and thus will it ever be.

<sup>63</sup> The miracle but calls your ancient name, which you will recognize
because the truth is in your memory. And to this name, your brother
calls for his release and yours. Heaven is shining on the Son of God.
Deny him not, that you may be released. Each instant is the Son of God
reborn, until he chooses not to die again. In every wish to hurt, he
chooses death instead of what his Father wills for him. Yet every
instant offers life to him because his Father wills that he should live.

<sup>64</sup> In crucifixion is redemption laid, for healing is not needed where
there is no pain or suffering. Forgiveness is the answer to attack of
any kind. So is attack deprived of its effects, and hate is answered in
the name of love. To you to whom it has been given to save the Son of
God from crucifixion and from hell and death, all glory be forever. For
you have power to save the Son of God because his Father willed that it
be so. And in your hands does all salvation lie, to be both offered and
received as one.

<sup>65</sup> To use the power God has given you as He would have it used is
natural. It is not arrogant to be as He created you or to make use of
what He gave to answer all His Son's mistakes and set him free. But it
*is* arrogant to lay aside the power that He gave and choose a little
senseless wish instead of what He wills. The gift of God to you *is*
limitless. There is no circumstance it cannot answer and no problem
which is not resolved within its gracious light.

<sup>66</sup> Abide in peace, where God would have you be, and be the means whereby
your brother finds the peace in which your wishes are fulfilled. Let us
unite in bringing blessing to the world of sin and death. For what can
save each one of us can save us all. There is no difference among the
Sons of God. The unity that specialness denies will save them all, for
what is one can have no specialness. And everything belongs to each of
them. No wishes lie between a brother and his own. To get from one is to
deprive them all. And yet to bless but one gives blessing to them all as
one.

<sup>67</sup> Your ancient name belongs to everyone, as theirs to you. Call on your
brother's name and God will answer, for on Him you call. Could He refuse
to answer when He has *already* answered all who call on Him? A miracle
can make no change at all. But it *can* make what always has been true
be recognized by those who know it not. And by this little gift of truth
but let to be itself—the Son of God allowed to be himself and all
creation freed to call upon the Name of God as one.
