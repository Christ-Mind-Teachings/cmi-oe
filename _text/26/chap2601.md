In the “dynamics” of attack is sacrifice a key idea. It is the pivot
upon which *all* compromise, *all* desperate attempts to strike a
bargain, and all conflicts achieve a seeming balance. It is the symbol
of the central theme that *somebody must lose*. Its focus on the body is
apparent, for it is always an attempt to *limit loss*. The body is
itself a sacrifice—a giving up of power in the name of saving just a
little for yourself. To see a brother in another body separate from
yours is the expression of a wish to see a little part of him and
sacrifice the rest. Look at the world, and you will see nothing attached
to anything beyond itself. All seeming entities can come a little nearer
or go a little farther off but *cannot* join.
