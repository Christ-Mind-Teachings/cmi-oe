<sup>18</sup> Complexity is not of God. How could it be, when all He knows is
*one*? He knows of *one* creation, *one* reality, *one* truth, and but
*one* Son. Nothing conflicts with oneness. How, then, could there be
complexity in Him? What is there to decide? For it is conflict that
makes choice \[complex\]. The truth is simple—it is one, without an
opposite. And how could strife enter in its simple presence and bring
complexity where oneness is? The truth makes no decisions, for there is
nothing to decide *between*. And only if there were could choosing be a
necessary step in the advance toward oneness. What is everything leaves
room for nothing else.

<sup>19</sup> Yet is this magnitude beyond the scope of this curriculum. Nor is it
necessary we dwell on anything that cannot be immediately grasped. There
is a borderland of thought which stands between this world and Heaven.
It is not a place, and when you reach it is apart from time. Here is the
meeting-place where thoughts are brought together—where conflicting
values meet and all illusions are laid down beside the truth where they
are judged to be untrue. This borderland is just beyond the gate of
Heaven. Here is every thought made pure and wholly simple. Here *is* sin
denied and everything that *is* received instead.

<sup>20</sup> This is the journey's end. We have referred to it as the “real
world.” And yet there is a contradiction here in that the words imply a
limited reality, a partial truth, a segment of the universe made true.
This is because knowledge makes no attack upon perception. They are
brought together, and only one continues past the gate where Oneness is.
Salvation is a borderland where place and time and choice have meaning
still, and yet it can be seen that they are temporary, out of place, and
every choice has been already made.

<sup>21</sup> Nothing the Son of God believes can be destroyed. But what is truth
to him must be brought to the last comparison that he will ever make,
the last evaluation that will be possible, the final judgment upon this
world. It is the judgment of the truth upon illusion, of knowledge on
perception—it has no meaning and does not exist. This is not your
decision. It is but a simple statement of a simple fact. But in this
world, there *are* no simple facts because what is the same and what is
different remain unclear. The one essential thing to make a choice at
all is this distinction. And herein lies the difference between the
worlds. In this one, choice is made impossible. In the real world is
choosing simplified.

<sup>22</sup> Salvation stops just short of Heaven, for only perception needs
salvation. Heaven was never lost and so cannot be saved. Yet who can
make a choice between the wish for Heaven and the wish for hell unless
he recognizes they are *not* the same? This difference is the learning
goal this course has set. It will not go beyond this aim. Its only
purpose is to teach what is the same and what is different, leaving room
to make the only choice which *can* be made.

<sup>23</sup> There is no basis for choice in this complex and over-complicated
world. For no one understands what is the same and seems to choose where
no choice really is. The real world is the area of choice made real, not
in the outcome but in the perception of *alternatives* for choice. That
there *is* choice is an illusion. Yet within this one lies the undoing
of *every* illusion, not excepting this.

<sup>24</sup> Is not this like your special function, where the separation is
undone by change of purpose in what once was specialness and now is
union? *All* illusions are but one. And in the recognition this is so
lies the ability to give up all attempts to choose between them and to
*make* them different. \[How simple is the choice between two things so
clearly *un*alike.\] There *is* no conflict here. No sacrifice is
possible in the relinquishment of an illusion *recognized* as such.
Where all reality has been withdrawn from what was never true, can it be
hard to give it up and choose what *must* be true?
