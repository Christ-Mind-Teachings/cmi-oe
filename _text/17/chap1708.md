<sup>65</sup> There is no problem in any situation that faith will not solve. There
is no shift in any aspect of the problem but will make solution
impossible. For if you shift part of the problem elsewhere, the meaning
of the problem *must* be lost, and the solution to the problem is
inherent in its meaning. Is it not possible that all your problems
*have* been solved, but you have removed yourself from the solution? Yet
faith must be where something has been done and where you *see* it done.
A situation is a relationship, being the joining of thoughts. If
problems are perceived, it is because the thoughts are judged to be in
conflict. But if the goal is truth, this is impossible. Some idea of
bodies must have entered, for minds cannot attack.

<sup>66</sup> The thought of bodies is the sign of faithlessness, for bodies cannot
solve anything. And it is their intrusion on the relationship, an error
in your thoughts *about* the situation, which then becomes the
justification for your lack of faith. You *will* make this error, but be
not at all concerned with that. The error does not matter. Faithlessness
brought to faith will never interfere with truth. But faithlessness used
*against* truth will always destroy faith. If you lack faith, ask that
it be restored where it was *lost* and seek not to have it made up to
you elsewhere as if you had been unjustly deprived of it.

<sup>67</sup> Only what *you* have not given can be lacking in *any* situation. But
remember this: the goal of holiness was set for your relationship and
*not* by you. You did not set it because holiness cannot be seen
*except* through faith, and your relationship was not holy *because*
your faith in one another was so limited and little. Your faith must
grow to meet the goal that has been set. The goal's reality will call
this forth, for you will see that peace and faith will not come
separately. What situation *can* you be in without faith and remain
faithful to each other?

<sup>68</sup> Every situation in which you find yourself is but a means to meet the
purpose set for your relationship. See it as something else, and you
*are* faithless. Use not your faithlessness. Let it enter and look upon
it calmly, but do not *use* it. Faithlessness is the servant of illusion
and wholly faithful to its master. Use it and it will carry you straight
to illusions. Be tempted not by what it offers you. It interferes not
with the goal, but with the value of the goal to *you*. Accept not the
illusion of peace it offers, but look upon its offering and recognize it
*is* illusion.

<sup>69</sup> The goal of illusion is as closely tied to faithlessness as faith to
truth. If you lack faith in anyone to fulfill, and *perfectly*, his part
in any situation dedicated in advance to truth, *your* dedication is
divided. And so you have been faithless to each other and used your
faithlessness *against* each other. No relationship is holy unless its
holiness goes with it everywhere. As holiness and faith go hand in hand,
so must its faith go everywhere with it. The goal's reality will call
forth and *accomplish* every miracle needed for its fulfillment. Nothing
too small or too enormous, too weak or too compelling, but will be
gently turned to its use and purpose. The universe will serve it gladly,
as it serves the universe. But do not *interfere*.

<sup>70</sup> The power set in you in whom the Holy Spirit's goal has been
established is so far beyond your little conception of the infinite that
you have no idea how great the strength that goes with you. And you can
use *this* in perfect safety. Yet for all its might, so great it reaches
past the stars and to the universe that lies beyond them, your little
faithlessness can make it useless if you would use the faithlessness
instead.

<sup>71</sup> Yet think on this, and learn the *cause* of faithlessness: You think
you hold against the other what he has done to you. But what you really
blame him for is what *you* did to *him*. It is not *his* past but
*yours* you hold against him. And you lack faith in him because of what
*you* were. Yet you are as innocent of what you were as he is. What
never was is causeless and is not *there* to interfere with truth. There
*is* no cause for faithlessness, but there *is* a Cause for faith. That
Cause has entered any situation which shares Its purpose. The light of
truth shines from the center of the situation and touches everyone to
whom the situation's purpose calls. It calls to *everyone*. There is no
situation which does not involve your *whole* relationship in every
aspect and complete in every part. You can leave nothing of yourself
outside it and keep the situation holy. For it shares the purpose of
your whole relationship and derives its meaning from it.

<sup>72</sup> Enter each situation with the faith that you give to each other, or
you *are* faithless to your own relationship. Your faith will call the
others to share your purpose, as this same purpose called forth the
faith in *you*. And you will see the means you once employed to lead you
to illusions transformed to means for truth. \[Truth calls for faith,
and faith makes room *for truth*.\] When the Holy Spirit changed the
purpose of your relationship by exchanging yours for His, the goal He
placed there was extended to every situation in which you enter or will
*ever* enter. And every situation was thus made free of the past, which
would have made it purposeless.

<sup>73</sup> You call for faith because of Him Who walks with you in *every*
situation. You are no longer wholly insane, nor no longer alone. For
loneliness in God *must* be a dream. You whose relationship shares the
Holy Spirit's goal are set apart from loneliness because the truth has
come. Its call for faith is strong. Use not your faithlessness against
it, for it calls you to salvation and to peace.
