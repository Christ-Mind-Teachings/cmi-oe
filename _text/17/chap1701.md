The betrayal of the Son of God lies only in illusions, and all his
“sins” are but his own imagining. His reality is forever sinless. He
need not be forgiven, but *awakened*. In his dreams he *has* betrayed
himself, his brothers, and his God. Yet what is done in dreams has not
been *really* done. It is impossible to convince the dreamer that this
is so, for dreams are what they are *because* of their illusion of
reality. Only in waking is the full release from them, for only then
does it become perfectly apparent that they had no effect on reality at
all and did not change it. Fantasies *change* reality. That is their
*purpose*. They cannot do so in reality, but they *can* do so in the
mind that would have reality different.

<sup>2</sup> It is, then, only your wish to change reality that is fearful, because
by your wish you think you have *accomplished* what you wish. This
strange position in a sense acknowledges your power. Yet by distorting
it and devoting it to “evil,” it also makes it unreal. You cannot be
faithful to two masters who ask of you conflicting things. What you use
in fantasy, you *deny* to truth. Yet what you *give* to truth to use for
you is safe from fantasy.
