<sup>82</sup> Would God have left the meaning of the world to your interpretation?
If He had, it *has* no meaning. For it cannot be that meaning changes
constantly and yet is true. The Holy Spirit looks upon the world as with
one purpose, changelessly established. And no situation can affect its
aim but must be in accord with it. For only if its aim could change with
every situation could each one be open to interpretation which is
different every time you think of it. You add an element into the script
you write for every minute in the day, and all that happens now means
something else. You take away another element, and every meaning shifts
accordingly.

<sup>83</sup> What do your scripts reflect except your plans for what the day
*should* be? And thus you judge disaster and success, advance, retreat,
and gain and loss. These judgments all are made according to the roles
the script assigns. The fact they have no meaning in themselves is
demonstrated by the ease with which these labels change with other
judgments made on different aspects of experience. And then in looking
back you think you see another meaning in what went before. What have
you really done except to show there *was* no meaning there? But you
assigned a meaning in the light of goals that change, with every meaning
shifting as they change.

<sup>84</sup> Only a constant purpose can endow events with stable meaning. But it
must accord *one* meaning to them all. If they are given different
meanings, it must be that they reflect but different purposes. And this
is all the meaning that they have. Can this *be* meaning? Can confusion
be what meaning means? Perception cannot be in constant flux and make
allowance for stability of meaning anywhere. Fear is a judgment never
justified. Its presence has no meaning but to show you wrote a fearful
script and are afraid accordingly. But not because the thing you fear
has fearful meaning in itself.

<sup>85</sup> A common *purpose* is the only means whereby perception can be
stabilized and one interpretation given to the world and all experiences
here. In this shared purpose is one \[meaning\] shared by everyone and
everything you see. You do not have to judge, for you have learned one
meaning has been given everything, and you are glad to see it
everywhere. It cannot change *because* you would perceive it everywhere,
unchanged by circumstance. And so you *offer* it to all events, and let
them offer you stability.

<sup>86</sup> Escape from judgment simply lies in thisâ€”all things have but one
purpose which you share with all the world. And nothing in the world can
be opposed to it, for it belongs to everything as it belongs to you. In
single purpose is the end of all ideas of sacrifice, which must assume a
different purpose for the one who gains and him who loses. There could
be no thought of sacrifice apart from this idea. And it is this idea of
different goals which makes perception shift and meaning change. In one
united goal does this become impossible, for your agreement makes
interpretation stabilize and last.

<sup>87</sup> How can communication really be established while the symbols which
are used mean different things? The Holy Spirit's goal gives one
interpretation, meaningful to you and to your brother. Thus can you
communicate with him and he with you. In symbols which you both can
understand, the sacrifice of meaning is undone. All sacrifice entails
the loss of your ability to see relationships among events. And looked
at separately, they *have* no meaning. For there is no light by which
they can be seen and understood. They have no purpose. And what they are
for cannot be seen. In any thought of loss, there *is* no meaning. No
one has agreed with you on what it means. It is a part of a distorted
script which cannot be interpreted with meaning. It must be forever
unintelligible. This is not communication. Your dark dreams are but the
senseless, isolated scripts you write in sleep. Look not to separate
dreams for meaning. Only dreams of pardon can be shared. They mean the
same to both of you.

<sup>88</sup> Do not interpret out of solitude, for what you see means nothing. It
will shift in what it stands for, and you will believe the world is an
uncertain place in which you walk in danger and uncertainty. It is but
your *interpretations* which are lacking in stability, for they are not
in line with what you really are. This is a state so seemingly unsafe
that fear *must* rise. Do not continue thus, my brothers. We have *one*
Interpreter. And through His use of symbols are we joined so that they
mean the same to all of us. Our common language lets us speak to all our
brothers and to understand with them forgiveness has been given to us
all, and thus we can communicate again.
