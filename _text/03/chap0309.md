<sup>72</sup> Every system of thought must have a starting point. It begins with
either a making or a creating, a difference which we have discussed
already. Their resemblance lies in their power as *foundations*. Their
difference lies in what rests upon them. Both are cornerstones for
systems of belief by which men live. It is a mistake to believe that a
thought system which is based on lies is weak. *Nothing* made by a Child
of God is without power. It is essential to realize this because
otherwise you will not understand why you have so much trouble with this
course and will be unable to escape from the prisons which you have made
for yourselves.

<sup>73</sup> You cannot resolve the authority problem by depreciating the power of
your minds. To do so is to deceive yourself, and this will hurt you
because you *know* the strength of the mind. You also know that you *cannot*
weaken it, any more than you can weaken God. The “devil” is a
frightening concept, because he is thought of as extremely powerful and
extremely active. He is perceived as a force in combat with God,
battling Him for possession of the Souls He created. He deceives by lies
and builds kingdoms of his own in which everything is in direct
opposition to God. Yet he *attracts* men rather than repels them, and they
are seen as willing to “sell” him their Souls in return for gifts they
*recognize* are of no real worth.

<sup>74</sup> This makes absolutely no sense. The whole picture is one in which man
acts in a way he *himself* realizes is self-destructive but which he does
not choose to correct and therefore perceives the cause as beyond his
control. We have discussed the fall, or separation, before, but its
meaning must be clearly understood without symbols. The separation is
not symbolic. It is an order of reality or a system of thought that is
real enough in time, though *not* in eternity. All beliefs are real to the
believer.

<sup>75</sup> The fruit of only *one* tree was “forbidden” to man in his symbolic
garden. But *God* could not have forbidden it or it could not have *been*
eaten. If God knows His Children, and I assure you that He does, would
He have put them in a position where their own destruction was possible?
The “tree” which was forbidden was named the “tree of knowledge.” Yet
God created knowledge and gave it freely to His creations. The symbolism
here has been given many interpretations, but you may be sure that *any*
interpretation which sees either God or His creations as capable of
destroying their own purpose is in error.

<sup>76</sup> Eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge is a symbolic expression
for incorporating into the self the ability for self-creating. This is
the *only* sense in which God and His Souls are *not* co-creators. The
belief that they are is implicit in the “self concept,” a concept now
made acceptable by its *weakness* and explained by a tendency of the self
to create an *image* of itself. Its fear aspect is often ascribed to fear
of retaliation by a “father figure,” a particularly curious idea in view
of the fact that no one uses the term to refer to the physical father.
It refers to an *image* of a father in relation to an *image* of the self.

<sup>77</sup> Images are perceived, *not* known. Knowledge cannot deceive, but
perception *can*. Man can perceive himself as self-creating, but he cannot
do more than *believe* it. He *cannot* make it true. And, as we said before,
when you finally perceive correctly, you can only be glad that you
cannot. But until then, the belief that you can is the central
foundation stone in your thought system, and all your defenses are used
to attack ideas which might bring it to light. You still believe you are
images of your own creation. Your minds are split with your Souls on
this point, and there is *no* resolution while you believe the one thing
that is literally inconceivable. That is why you *cannot* create and are
filled with fear about what you make.

<sup>78</sup> The mind can make the belief in separation *very* real and *very*
fearful, and this belief *is* the “devil.” It is powerful, active,
destructive, and clearly in opposition to God because it literally
denies His Fatherhood. Never underestimate the power of this denial.
Look at your lives and see what the devil has made. But know that this
making will surely dissolve in the light of truth, because its
*foundation* is a lie.

<sup>79</sup> Your creation by God is the *only* foundation which cannot be shaken
because the light is *in* it. Your starting point is truth, and you must
return to this beginning. Much has been perceived since then, but
nothing else has happened. That is why your Souls are still in peace,
even though your minds are in conflict. You have not yet gone back far
enough, and that is why you become so fearful. As you approach the
beginning, you feel the fear of the destruction of your thought system
upon you, as if it were the fear of death. There *is* no death, but there
*is* a belief in death.

<sup>80</sup> The Bible says that the branch that bears no fruit will be cut off
and will wither away. Be glad! The light *will* shine from the true
Foundation of Life, and your own thought system *will* stand corrected. It
*cannot* stand otherwise. You who fear salvation are *willing* death. Life
and death, light and darkness, knowledge and perception are
irreconcilable. To believe that they can be reconciled is to believe
that God and man can *not*. Only the oneness of knowledge is conflictless.
Your kingdom is not of this world because it was given you from *beyond*
this world. Only *in* this world is the idea of an authority problem
meaningful. The world is not left by death but by truth, and truth can
be known by all those for whom the Kingdom was created and for whom it
waits.
