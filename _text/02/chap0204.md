<sup>72</sup> You believe that “being afraid” is involuntary, something beyond your
control. Yet I have told you several times that only *constructive* acts
should be involuntary. We have said that Christ-control can take over
everything that does *not* matter, while Christ-guidance can direct
everything that *does* if you so choose. Fear cannot be Christ-controlled,
but it *can* be self-controlled. It *prevents* me from controlling it. The
correction is therefore a matter of *your* will, because its presence
shows that you have raised the *unimportant* to a higher level than it
warrants. You have thus brought it under *your* will, where it does not
belong. This means that *you* feel responsible for it. The level confusion
here is obvious.

<sup>73</sup> The reason I cannot control fear for you is that you are attempting
to raise to the mind level the proper content of lower-order reality. I
do not foster level confusion, but *you* can choose to correct it. You
would not tolerate insane *behavior* on your part and would hardly advance
the excuse that you could not help it. Why should you tolerate insane
*thinking*? There is a confusion here which you would do well to look at
clearly. *You* believe that you are responsible for what you *do* but *not*
for what you *think*. The truth is that you are responsible for what you
think because it is only at this level that you *can* exercise choice.

<sup>74</sup> What you do *comes from* what you think. You cannot separate yourself
from the truth by “giving” autonomy to behavior. This is controlled by
me automatically as soon as you place what you think under my guidance.
Whenever you are afraid, it is a sure sign that you have allowed your
mind to miscreate or have not allowed me to guide it. It is pointless to
believe that controlling the *outcome* of mis-thought can result in
healing. When you are fearful, you have willed wrongly. This is why you
feel responsible for it. You must change your *mind*, not your behavior,
and this *is* a matter of will.

<sup>75</sup> You do not need guidance *except* at the mind level. Correction belongs
*only* at the level where creation is possible. The term does not mean
anything at the symptom level, where it cannot work. The correction of
fear is your responsibility. When you ask for release from fear, you are
implying that it is not. You should ask instead for help in the
conditions which have brought the fear about. These conditions *always*
entail a separated mind willingness. At that level, you can help it. You
are much too tolerant of mind wandering, thus passively condoning its
miscreations. The particular result does not matter, but the fundamental
error *does*. The correction is always the same. Before you will to do
anything, ask me if your will is in accord with mine. If you are sure
that it is, there will *be* no fear.

<sup>76</sup> Fear is always a sign of strain, which arises whenever the *will* to do
conflicts with *what* you do. This situation arises in two ways:

<sup>77</sup> First, you can will to do conflicting things, either simultaneously
or successively. This produces conflicted behavior, which is intolerable
to yourself because the part of the will that wants to do something *else*
is outraged.

<sup>78</sup> Second, you can *behave* as you think you should but without entirely
*willing* to do so. This produces consistent behavior but entails great
strain *within* the self.

<sup>79</sup> In both cases, the will and the behavior are out of accord, resulting
in a situation in which you are doing what you do *not* will. This arouses
a sense of coercion, which usually produces rage. The rage then invades
the mind and projection in the wrong sense is likely to follow.
Depression or anxiety is virtually certain.[^2]

<sup>80</sup> Remember that whenever there is fear, it is because you have *not
made up your mind*. Your will is split, and your behavior inevitably
becomes erratic. Correcting at the behavioral level can shift the error
from the first to the second type of strain described above but will *not*
obliterate the fear. It is possible to reach a state in which you bring
your will under my guidance without much conscious effort, but this
implies habit patterns which you have not developed dependably as yet.
God cannot ask *more* than you will. The strength to *do* comes from your
own undivided *will* to do. There is *no* strain in doing God's Will as soon
as you recognize that it is also your *own*.

<sup>81</sup> The lesson here is quite simple but particularly apt to be
overlooked. I will therefore repeat it, urging you to listen. Only your
*mind* can produce fear. It does so whenever it is conflicted in what it
wills, thus producing inevitable strain because willing and doing become
discordant. This cannot be corrected by better *doing*, but it *can* be
corrected by higher *willing*.
