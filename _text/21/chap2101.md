Projection makes perception. The world you see is what you gave it,
nothing more than that. But though it is no more than that, it is not
less. Therefore, to you it is important. It is the witness to your state
of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition. As a man thinketh,
so does he perceive. Therefore, seek not to change the world, but will
to change your mind *about* the world. Perception is a *result*, not a
cause. And that is why order of difficulty in miracles is meaningless.
Everything looked upon with vision is healed and holy. Nothing perceived
without it means anything. And where there is no meaning, there is
chaos.

<sup>2</sup> Damnation is your judgment on yourself, and this you *will* project
upon the world. See it as damned, and all you see is what you did to
hurt the Son of God. If you behold disaster and catastrophe, you tried
to crucify him. If you see holiness and hope, you joined the Will of God
to set him free. There is no choice that lies between these two
decisions. And you *will* see the witness to the choice you made and
learn from this to *recognize* which one you chose. \[The world you see
but shows you how much joy *you* have allowed yourself to see in you and
to accept as *yours*. And if this *is* its meaning, then the power to
*give* it joy *must* lie *within* you.\]
