We said before that when a situation has been dedicated wholly to truth,
peace is inevitable. Its attainment is the criterion by which the
wholeness of the dedication can be safely assumed. Yet we also said that
peace without faith will *never* be attained, for what is wholly
dedicated to truth as its only goal is brought to truth *by* faith. This
faith encompasses everyone involved, for only thus the situation is
perceived as meaningful and as a whole. And everyone must be involved in
it, or else your faith is limited and your dedication incomplete.

<sup>2</sup> Every situation properly perceived becomes an opportunity to heal the
Son of God. And he is healed *because* you offered faith to him, giving
him to the Holy Spirit and releasing him from every demand your ego
would make of him. Thus do you see him free, and in this vision does the
Holy Spirit share. And since He shares it, He has given it, and so He
heals through *you*. It is this joining Him in a united purpose which
makes this purpose real because you make it *whole*. And this *is*
healing. The body is healed because you came without it and joined the
mind in which all healing rests.
