<sup>35</sup> This course is not beyond *immediate* learning unless you prefer to
believe that what God wills takes time. And this means only that you
would *rather* delay the recognition that His Will is so. The holy
instant is *this* one and *every* one. The one you *want* it to be it
*is*. The one you would not have it be is lost to you. *You* must decide
on when it is. Delay it not. For beyond the past and future, in which
you will not find it, it stands in shimmering readiness for your
acceptance. Yet you cannot bring it into glad awareness while you do not
want it, for it holds the whole release from littleness.

<sup>36</sup> Your practice must therefore rest upon your willingness to let all
littleness go. The instant in which magnitude will dawn upon you is but
as far away as your *desire* for it. As long as you desire it not and
cherish littleness instead, by so much is it far from you. By so much as
you want it will you bring it nearer. Think not that you can find
salvation in your own way and *have* it. Give over *every* plan that you
have made for your salvation in exchange for God's. His will content
you, and there is nothing else that can bring you peace. For peace is of
God and of no one beside Him.

<sup>37</sup> Be humble before Him and yet great *in* Him. And value no plan of the
ego before the plan of God. For you leave empty your place in His plan,
which you must fulfill if you would join with me, by your decision to
join in any plan *but* His. I call you to fulfill your holy part in the
plan that He has given to the world for its release from littleness. God
would have His host abide in perfect freedom. Every allegiance to a plan
of salvation that is apart from Him diminishes the value of His Will for
you in your own minds. And yet it is your mind that *is* the host to
Him.

<sup>38</sup> Would you learn how perfect and immaculate is the holy altar on which
your Father has placed Himself? This you will recognize in the holy
instant in which you willingly and gladly give over every plan but His.
For there lies peace, perfectly clear because you have been willing to
meet its conditions. You can claim the holy instant any time and
anywhere you want it. In your practice, try to give over every plan you
have accepted for finding magnitude in littleness. *It is not there*.
Use the holy instant only to recognize that you alone *cannot* know
where it is and can only deceive yourself.

<sup>39</sup> I stand within the holy instant, as clear as you would have me. And
the extent to which you learn to be willing to accept me is the measure
of the time in which the holy instant will be yours. I call to you to
make the holy instant yours at once, for the release from littleness in
the mind of the host of God depends on willingness and *not* on time.
The reason why this course is simple is that *truth* is simple.
Complexity is of the ego and is nothing more than the ego's attempt to
obscure the obvious.

<sup>40</sup> You could live forever in the holy instant, *beginning now* and
reaching to eternity, but for a very simple reason. Do not obscure the
simplicity of this reason, for if you do, it will be only because you
prefer not to recognize it and not to let it go. The simple reason,
simply stated, is this: The holy instant is a time in which you receive
and *give* perfect communication. This means, however, that it is a time
in which your mind is *open*, both to receive and give. It is the
recognition that all minds *are* in communication. It therefore seeks to
*change* nothing, but merely to *accept* everything.

<sup>41</sup> How can you do this when you would prefer to have *private* thoughts
and *keep* them? The only way you could do *that* is to *deny* the
perfect communication that makes the holy instant what it is. You
believe that it is possible to harbor thoughts you would not share and
that salvation lies in keeping your thoughts to yourself *alone.* For in
private thoughts, known only to yourself, you think you find a way to
keep what you would *have* alone and share what *you* would share. And
then you wonder why it is that you are not in full communication with
those around you and with God Who surrounds *all* of you together.

<sup>42</sup> Every thought you would keep hidden shuts communication off because
you would *have* it so. It is impossible to recognize perfect
communication while *breaking* communication holds value to you. Ask
yourselves honestly, “Would I *want* to have perfect communication, and
am I wholly willing to let everything that interferes with it go
forever?” If the answer is no, then the Holy Spirit's readiness to give
it to you is not enough to make it yours, for you are not ready to
*share* it with Him. And it cannot come into a mind that has decided to
oppose it. For the holy instant is given and received with *equal*
willingness, being the acceptance of the single will that governs *all*
thought.

<sup>43</sup> The necessary condition for the holy instant does *not* require that
you have no thoughts which are not pure. But it *does* require that you
have none that you would *keep*. Innocence is not of your making. It is
given you the instant you would *have* it. Yet it would not be Atonement
if there were no *need* for Atonement. You will not be able to accept
perfect communication as long as you would *hide* it from yourself. For
what you would hide *is* hidden from you.

<sup>44</sup> In your practice, then, try only to be vigilant against deception and
seek not to protect the thoughts you would keep unto yourself. Let the
Holy Spirit's purity shine them away and bring all your awareness to the
readiness for purity He offers you. Thus will He make you ready to
acknowledge that you *are* host to God and hostage to no one and
nothing.
