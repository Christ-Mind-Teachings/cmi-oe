<sup>22</sup> Be not content with littleness, but be sure you understand what
littleness is and why you could never *be* content with it. Littleness
is the offering you gave *yourself*. You offered this in place of
magnitude, and you *accepted* it. Everything in this world is little
because it is a world made out of littleness in the strange belief that
littleness can content you. When you strive for anything in this world
with the belief that it will bring you peace, you are belittling
yourself and blinding yourself to glory. Littleness and glory are the
choices open to your striving and your vigilance. You will always choose
one at the *expense* of the other.

<sup>23</sup> Yet what you do not realize each time you choose is that your choice
is your evaluation of *yourself*. Choose littleness and you will not
have peace, for you will have judged yourself unworthy of it. And
whatever you offer as a substitute is much too poor a gift to satisfy
you. It is essential that you accept the fact, and accept it gladly,
that there is no form of littleness that can *ever* content you. You are
free to try as many as you wish, but all you will be doing is to delay
your homecoming. For you will be content only in magnitude, which is
your home.

<sup>24</sup> There is a deep responsibility you owe yourself, and one which you
must learn to remember all the time. The lesson will seem hard at first,
but you will learn to love it when you realize that it is true and
constitutes a tribute to your power. You who have sought and found
littleness, remember this: Every decision which you make stems from what
you think you *are* and represents the value that you *put* upon
yourself. Believe the little can content you, and by limiting yourself,
you will not be satisfied. For your function is *not* little, and it is
only by finding your function and fulfilling it that you can escape from
littleness.

<sup>25</sup> There is no doubt about what your function is, for the Holy Spirit
*knows* what it is. There is no doubt about its magnitude, for it
reaches you through Him *from* Magnitude. You do not have to strive for
it because you *have* it. All your striving must be directed *against*
littleness, for it *does* require vigilance to protect your magnitude in
this world. To hold your magnitude in perfect awareness in a world of
littleness is a task the little cannot undertake. Yet it is asked of you
in tribute to your magnitude and *not* your littleness. Nor is it asked
of you alone.

<sup>26</sup> The power of God will support every effort you make on behalf of His
dear Son. Search for the little, and you deny yourself His power. God is
not willing that His Son be content with less than everything. For He is
not content without His Son, and His Son cannot be content with less
than his Father has given him. We asked you once before, “Would you be
hostage to the ego or host to God?” Let this question be asked you by
the Holy Spirit in you every time you make a decision. For every
decision you make *does* answer this and invites sorrow or joy
accordingly.

<sup>27</sup> When God gave Himself to you in your creation, He established you as
host to Him forever. He has not left you, and you have not left Him. All
your attempts to deny His magnitude and make His Son hostage to the ego
cannot make little whom God has joined with Him. Every decision you make
is for Heaven or for hell and will bring you awareness of what you
decided *for*. The Holy Spirit can hold your magnitude, clean of all
littleness, clearly and in perfect safety in your minds, untouched by
every little gift the world of littleness would offer you. But for this,
you cannot side *against* Him in what He wills for you.

<sup>28</sup> Decide for God through Him. For littleness and the belief that you
can be content with littleness are the decisions you have made about
yourself. The power and the glory that lie in you from God are for all
who, like you, perceive themselves as little and have deceived
themselves into believing that littleness can be blown up by them into a
sense of magnitude that can content them. Neither give littleness, nor
accept it. All honor is due the host of God. Your littleness deceives
you, but your magnitude is of Him Who dwells in you and in Whom you
dwell. Touch no one, then, with littleness, in the name of Christ,
eternal Host unto His Father.

<sup>29</sup> In this season (Christmas), which celebrates the birth of holiness
into this world, join with me, who decided for holiness for *you.* It is
our task *together* to restore the awareness of magnitude to the host
whom God appointed for Himself. It is beyond all your littleness to give
the gift of God, but *not* beyond *you*. For God would give Himself
*through* you. He reaches from you to everyone and beyond everyone to
His Son's creations, but without leaving you. Far beyond your little
world but still in you, He extends forever. Yet He brings all his
extensions to you as host to Him.

<sup>30</sup> Is it a sacrifice to leave littleness behind and wander not in vain?
It is not sacrifice to wake to glory. But it *is* a sacrifice to accept
anything *less* than glory. Learn that you *must* be worthy of the
Prince of Peace, born in you in honor of Him Whose host you are. You
know not what love means because you have sought to purchase it with
little gifts, thus valuing it too little to be able to understand its
magnitude. Love is *not* little, and love dwells in you, for you are
host to Him. Before the greatness that lives in you, your poor
appreciation of yourself and all the little offerings you have given
slip into nothingness. Holy Child of God, when will you learn that
*only* holiness can content you and give you peace?

<sup>31</sup> Remember that you learn not for yourself alone, no more than I did.
It is *because* I learned for you that you can learn of me. I would but
teach you what is yours, so that together we can replace the shabby
littleness that binds the host of God to guilt and weakness with the
glad awareness of the glory that is in him. My birth in you is your
awakening to grandeur. Welcome me not into a manger but into the altar
to holiness, where holiness abides in perfect peace. My Kingdom is not
of this world because it is in *you.* And you are of your Father. Let us
join in honoring you, who must remain forever beyond littleness.

<sup>32</sup> Decide with me, who have decided to abide with you. I will as my
Father wills, knowing His Will is constant and at peace forever with
Itself. You will be content with nothing *but* His Will. Accept no less,
remembering that everything I learned is yours. What my Father loves, I
love as He does, and I can no more accept it as what it is not than He
can. And no more can *you*. When you have learned to accept what you
are, you will make no more gifts to offer to yourselves, for you will
know you are complete, in need of nothing, and unable to accept
*anything* for yourself. But you will gladly give, *having* received.
The host of God need not seek to find anything.

<sup>33</sup> If you are wholly willing to leave salvation to the plan of God and
unwilling to attempt to grasp for peace yourself, salvation will be
*given* you. Yet think not you can substitute your plan for His. Rather,
join with me in His that we may release all those who would be bound,
proclaiming together that the Son of God is host to Him. Thus will we
let no one forget what *you* would remember. And thus will you remember
it.

<sup>34</sup> Call forth in everyone only the remembrance of God and of the Heaven
that is in him. For where you would help your brother be, there will you
think *you* are. Hear not his call for hell and littleness, but only his
call for Heaven and greatness. Forget not that his call is yours, and
answer him with me. God's power is forever on the side of His host, for
it protects only the peace in which He dwells. Lay not littleness before
His holy altar, which rises above the stars and reaches even to Heaven
because of what is given it.
