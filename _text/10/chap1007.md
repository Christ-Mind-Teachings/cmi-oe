<sup>59</sup> It is impossible not to believe what you see, but it is equally
impossible to see what you do *not* believe. Perceptions are built up on
the basis of experience, and experience leads to beliefs. It is not
until beliefs are fixed that perceptions stabilize. In effect, then,
what you believe, you *do* see. That is what I meant when I said,
“Blessed are ye who have not seen and still believe,” for those who
believe in the resurrection *will* see it. The resurrection is the
complete triumph of Christ over the ego, not by attack but by
transcendence. For Christ *does* rise above the ego and all its works
and ascends to the Father and *His* Kingdom.

<sup>60</sup> Would you join in the resurrection or the crucifixion? Would you
condemn your brothers or free them? Would you transcend *your* prison
and ascend to the Father? For these questions are all the same and are
answered together. There has been much confusion about what perception
means because the same word is used both for awareness and for the
*interpretation* of awareness. Yet you cannot *be* aware without
interpretation, and what you perceive *is* your interpretation. This
course is perfectly clear. You do not see it clearly because you are
interpreting *against* it and therefore do not *believe* it. And if
belief determines perception, you do *not* perceive what it means and
therefore do not *accept* it.

<sup>61</sup> Yet different experiences lead to different beliefs, \[and with them,
different perceptions. For perceptions are learned with beliefs,\] and
experience teaches. I am leading you to a new kind of experience, which
you will become less and less willing to deny. Learning of Christ is
easy, for to perceive with Him involves no strain at all. *His*
perceptions are your *natural* awareness, and it is only distortions
which *you* introduce that tire you. Let the Christ in you interpret
*for* you, and do not try to limit what you see by narrow little beliefs
which are unworthy of God's Son. For until Christ comes into His own,
the Son of God *will* see himself as fatherless.

<sup>62</sup> I am *your* resurrection and *your* life. You live in me because you
live in God. And everyone lives in *you*, as *you* live in everyone. Can
you, then, perceive unworthiness in a brother and *not* perceive it in
yourself? And can you perceive it in yourself and *not* perceive it in
God? Believe in the resurrection because it has *been* accomplished, and
it has been accomplished *in you*. This is as true now as it will ever
be, for the resurrection is the Will of God, which knows no time and no
exceptions. But make no exceptions yourself, or you will not perceive
what has been accomplished *for* you. For we ascend unto the Father
together, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, for
such is the nature of God's Son as His Father created him.

<sup>63</sup> Do not underestimate the power of the devotion of God's Son nor the
power of the god he worships over him. For he places *himself* at the
altar of his god, whether it be the god he made or the God who created
him. That is why his slavery is as complete as his freedom, for he will
obey *only* the god he accepts. The god of the crucifixion demands that
he crucify, and his worshipers obey. In his name they crucify
*themselves*, believing that the power of the Son of God is born of
sacrifice and pain. The God of the resurrection demands *nothing*, for
He does not will to take away. He does not require obedience, for
obedience implies submission. He would only have you learn your *own*
will and follow it, not in the spirit of sacrifice and submission, but
in the gladness of freedom.

<sup>64</sup> Resurrection must compel your allegiance gladly because it is the
symbol of joy. Its whole compelling power lies in the fact that it
represents what *you* want to be. The freedom to leave behind everything
that hurts you and humbles you and frightens you cannot be thrust upon
you, but it *can* be offered you through the grace of God. And you can
*accept* it by His grace, for God *is* gracious to His Son, accepting
him without question as His own. Who, then, is *your* own? The Father
has given you all that is His, and He Himself is yours *with* them.
Guard them in their resurrection, for otherwise you will not awake in
God, safely surrounded by what is yours forever.

<sup>65</sup> You will not find peace until you have removed the nails from the
hands of God's Son and taken the last thorn from his forehead. The love
of God surrounds His Son, whom the god of the crucifixion condemns.
Teach not that I died in vain. Teach rather that I did *not* die by
demonstrating that I live *in you*. For the *undoing* of the crucifixion
of God's Son is the work of the redemption, in which everyone has a part
of equal value. God does not judge His blameless Son. Having given
*Himself* to him, how could it be otherwise?

<sup>66</sup> You have nailed *yourself* to a cross and placed a crown of thorns
upon your *own* head. Yet you *cannot* crucify God's Son, for the Will
of God cannot die. His Son *has been* redeemed from his own crucifixion,
and you cannot assign to death whom God has given eternal life. The
dream of crucifixion still lies heavy on your eyes, but what you see in
dreams is not reality. While you perceive the Son of God as crucified,
you are asleep. And as long as you believe that *you* can crucify him,
you are only having nightmares. You who are beginning to wake are still
aware of dreams and have not yet forgotten them. The forgetting of
dreams and the awareness of Christ comes with the awakening of others to
*share* your redemption.

<sup>67</sup> You will awaken to your *own* call, for the Call to awake is *within*
you. If I live in you, you *are* awake. Yet you must see the works I do
through you, or you will not perceive that I have done them *unto* you.
Do not set limits on what you believe I can do through you, or you will
not accept what I can do *for* you. For it is done *already*, and unless
you give all that you have received, you will not know that your
Redeemer liveth and that *you* have awakened *with* Him. Redemption is
recognized *only* by sharing it.

<sup>68</sup> God's Son *is* saved. Bring only *this* awareness to the Sonship, and
you will have a part in the redemption as valuable as mine. For your
part must be *like* mine if you learn it of me. If you believe that
*yours* is limited, *you* are limiting *mine*. There is no order of
difficulty in miracles because all of God's Sons are of equal value, and
their equality is their oneness. The whole power of God is in every part
of Him, and nothing contradictory to His Will is either great or small.
What does not exist has *no* size and *no* measure. To God *all* things
are possible. And to Christ it is given to be *like* the Father.
