<sup>24</sup> What do you *want*? Light or darkness, knowledge or ignorance are
yours, but not both. Opposites must be brought together and not kept
apart. For their separation is only in your mind, and they are
reconciled by union, as *you* are. In union, everything that is not real
*must* disappear, for truth *is* union. As darkness disappears in light,
so ignorance fades away when knowledge dawns. Perception is the medium
by which ignorance is brought to knowledge. Yet the perception must be
without deceit, for otherwise it becomes the messenger of ignorance
rather than a helper in the search for truth.

<sup>25</sup> The search for truth is but the honest searching out of everything
that interferes with truth. Truth *is*. It can be neither lost nor
sought nor found. It is there, wherever *you* are, being *within* you.
Yet it *can* be recognized or unrecognized, real or false to *you*. If
you hide it, it becomes unreal to you *because* you hid it and
surrounded it with fear. Under each cornerstone of fear on which you
have erected your insane system of belief, the truth lies hidden. Yet
you cannot know this, for by hiding truth in fear, you see no reason to
believe the *more* you look at fear, the *less* you see it, and the
clearer what it *conceals* becomes.

<sup>26</sup> It is not possible to convince the unknowing that they know. From
their point of view, it is not true. Yet it *is* true because *God*
knows it. These are clearly opposite viewpoints of what the “unknowing”
are. To God, unknowing is impossible. It is therefore not a point of
view at all but merely a belief in something that does not exist. It is
only this belief that the unknowing have, and by it they are wrong about
themselves. They have *defined* themselves as they were not created.
Their creation was not a point of view, but rather a certainty.
Uncertainty brought to certainty does not retain *any* conviction of
reality.

<sup>27</sup> You must have noticed that the emphasis has been on bringing what is
undesirable *to* the desirable; what you do *not* want to what you *do*.
You will realize that salvation must come to you this way if you
consider what dissociation is. Dissociation is a distorted process of
thinking whereby two systems of belief which cannot coexist are both
*maintained*. It has *been* recognized that if they were brought
*together* their joint acceptance would become impossible. But if one is
kept in darkness from the other, their *separation* seems to keep them
both alive and equal in their reality. Their joining thus becomes the
source of fear, for if they meet, acceptance *must* be withdrawn from
one of them.

<sup>28</sup> You *cannot* have them both, for each denies the other. Apart, this
fact is lost from sight, for each in a *separate* place can be endowed
with firm belief. Bring them *together*, and the fact of their complete
incompatibility is instantly apparent. One will go *because* the other
is seen in the same place. Light cannot enter darkness when a mind
believes in darkness and will not *let* it go. Truth does not struggle
against ignorance, and love does not attack fear. What needs no
protection does not defend itself. Defense is of *your* making. God
knows it not. The Holy Spirit uses defenses on *behalf* of truth only
because you made them *against* it. His perception of them, according to
His purpose, merely changes them into a call *for* what you have
*attacked* with them.

<sup>29</sup> Defenses, like everything you made, must be gently turned to your own
good, translated by the Holy Spirit from means of self-destruction to
means of preservation and release. His task is mighty, but the power of
God is with Him. Therefore, to Him it is so easy that it was
accomplished the instant it was given Him for you. Do not delay
yourselves in your return to peace by wondering how He can fulfill what
God has given Him to do. Leave that to Him Who knows. You are not asked
to do mighty tasks yourself. You are merely asked to do the little He
suggests you do, trusting Him only to the small extent of believing that
if He asks it, you *can* do it. You will *see* how easily all that He
asks can be accomplished.

<sup>30</sup> The Holy Spirit asks of you but this—bring to Him every secret you
have locked away from Him. Open every door to Him and bid Him enter the
darkness and lighten it away. At your request He enters gladly. He
brings the light to darkness if you make the darkness *open* to Him. But
what you hide He cannot look upon. For He sees for *you*, and unless you
look *with* Him, He cannot see. The vision of Christ is not for Him
alone but for Him with *you*. Bring, therefore, all your dark and secret
thoughts to Him and look upon them *with* Him. He holds the light, and
you the darkness. They *cannot* coexist when both of you together look
on them. His judgment *must* prevail, and He will *give* it to you as
you join your perception to His. Joining with Him in seeing is the way
in which you learn to share with Him the interpretation of perception
that leads to knowledge.

<sup>31</sup> You cannot see alone. Sharing perception with Him Whom God has given
you teaches you how to *recognize* what you see. It is the recognition
that nothing you see means *anything* alone. Seeing with Him will show
you that all meaning, including *yours*, comes not from double vision
but from the gentle fusing of everything into *one* meaning, *one*
emotion, and *one* purpose. God has one purpose which He shares with
you. The single vision which the Holy Spirit offers you will bring this
oneness to your mind with clarity and brightness so intense you could
not wish for all the world not to accept what God would have you have.
Behold your will, accepting it as His, with all His love as yours. All
honor to you through Him, and through Him unto God.

<sup>32</sup> In the darkness you have obscured the glory God gave you and the
power He bestowed upon His guiltless Son. All this lies hidden in every
darkened place shrouded in guilt and in the dark denial of innocence.
Behind the dark doors which you have closed lies nothing, because
nothing *can* obscure the gift of God. It is the closing of the doors
that interferes with recognition of the power of God that shines in you.
Banish not power from your mind, but let all that would hide your glory
be brought to the judgment of the Holy Spirit and there undone. Whom He
would save for glory *is* saved for it. He has promised the Father that
through Him you would be released from littleness to glory. To what He
promised God He is wholly faithful, for He shared with God the promise
that was given Him to share with *you.*

<sup>33</sup> He shares it still, for *you*. Everything that promises otherwise,
great or small, however much or little valued, He will replace with the
*one* promise given unto Him to lay upon the altar to your Father and
His Son. No altar stands to God *without* His Son. And nothing brought
there that is not equally worthy of both but will be replaced by gifts
wholly acceptable to Father *and* to Son. Can you offer guilt to God?
You cannot, then, offer it to His Son. For they are not apart, and gifts
to one *are* offered to the other.

<sup>34</sup> You know not God because you know not this. And yet you *do* know God
and *also* this. All this is safe within you, where the Holy Spirit
shines. He shines not in division, but in the meeting place where God,
united with His Son, speaks to His Son through Him. Communication
between what cannot be divided *cannot* cease. The holy meeting place of
the unseparated Father and His Son lies in the Holy Spirit and in *you*.
All interference in the communication that God Himself wills with His
Son is quite impossible here. Unbroken and uninterrupted love flows
constantly between the Father and the Son, as *both* would have it be.
And so it *is*.

<sup>35</sup> Let your minds wander not through darkened corridors, away from
light's center. You may choose to lead yourselves astray, but you can
only be brought *together* by the Guide appointed for you. He will
surely lead you to where God and His Son await your recognition. They
are joined in giving you the gift of oneness, before which *all*
separation vanishes. Unite with what you *are.* You *cannot* join with
anything except reality. God's glory and His Son's belong to you in
truth. They *have* no opposite, and nothing else *can* you bestow upon
yourselves.

<sup>36</sup> There is no substitute for truth. And truth will make this plain to
you as you are brought into the place where you must *meet* with truth.
And there you must be led, through gentle understanding which can lead
you nowhere else. Where God is, there are *you*. Such *is* the truth.
Nothing can change the knowledge given you by God into unknowingness.
Everything God created knows its Creator. For this is how creation is
accomplished by the Creator and by His creations. In the holy meeting
place are joined the Father and His creations, and the creations of His
Son with them together. There is one link which joins them all together,
holding them in the oneness out of which creation happens.

<sup>37</sup> The link with which the Father joins Himself to those He gives the
power to create like Him can *never* be dissolved. Heaven itself is
union with all of creation and with its One Creator. And Heaven remains
the Will of God for you. Lay no gifts other than this upon your altars,
for nothing can coexist beside it. Here your meager offerings are
brought together with the gift of God, and only what is worthy of the
Father will be accepted by the Son, for whom it was intended. To whom
God gives Himself, He *is* given. Your little gifts will vanish on the
altar where He has placed His Own.
