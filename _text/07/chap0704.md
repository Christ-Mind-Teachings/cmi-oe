<sup>19</sup> To heal is to liberate totally. We once said there is no order of
difficulty in miracles, because they are *all* maximal expressions of
love. This has no range at all. The non-maximal only *appears* to have a
range. This is because it *seems* to be meaningful to measure it *from*
the maximum and identify its position by *how much* it is *not* there.
Actually, this does not mean anything. It is like negative numbers in
that the concept can be used theoretically, but it has no application
practically. It is true that if you put three apples on the table and
then take them away, the three apples are not there. But it is *not*
true that the table is now *minus* three apples. If there is *nothing*
on the table, it does not matter what *was* there in terms of amount.
The “nothing” is neither greater nor less because of what is absent.

<sup>20</sup> That is why “all” and “nothing” are dichotomous, *without* a range.
This is perfectly clear in considering psychological tests of maximal
performance. You cannot interpret the results *at all* unless you assume
either *maximal* motivation or *no* motivation at all. Only in these two
conditions can you validly compare responses, and you *must* assume the
former, because if the latter were true, the subject would not do
*anything*. Given *variable* motivation, he *will* do something, but
*you* cannot understand *what it is*.

<sup>21</sup> The results of such tests are evaluated relatively *assuming* maximal
motivation, but this is because we are dealing with *abilities*, where
degree of development is meaningful. This does *not* mean that what the
ability is used *for* is necessarily either limited *or* divided. Yet
one thing is certain—abilities are *potentials* for learning, and you
will apply them to what you *want* to learn. Learning is *effort*, and
effort means *will.* We have used the term “abilities” in the plural,
because abilities began with the ego, which perceived them as
*potentials for excelling*. This is how the ego *still* perceives them
and uses them.

<sup>22</sup> The ego does not *want* to teach everyone all it has learned, because
that would *defeat* its purpose. Therefore, it does not *really* learn
at all. The Holy Spirit teaches you to use what the ego has made to
teach the *opposite* of what the ego has learned. The *kind* of learning
is as irrelevant as is the particular ability which was applied *to* the
learning. You could not have a better example of the Holy Spirit's
unified purpose than this course. The Holy Spirit has taken very
diversified areas of *your* learning and has applied them to a *unified*
curriculum. The fact that this was *not* the ego's reason for learning
is totally irrelevant.

<sup>23</sup> *You* made the effort to learn, and the Holy Spirit has a unified
goal for *all* effort. He *adapts* the ego's potentials for excelling to
potentials for *equalizing*. This makes them *useless* for the ego's
purpose but *very* useful for His. If different abilities are applied
long enough to one goal, the abilities *themselves* become unified. This
is because they are channelized in one direction or in one *way*.
Ultimately, then, they all contribute to *one result*, and by so doing,
their similarity rather than their differences is emphasized. You can
*excel* in many *different* ways, but you can *equalize* in *one way
only*. Equality is *not* a variable state, by definition.

<sup>24</sup> That is why you will be able to perform *all* aspects of your work
with ease when you have learned *this* course. To the ego there appears
to be no connection, because the *ego* is discontinuous. Yet the Holy
Spirit teaches *one* lesson and applies it to *all* individuals in *all*
situations. Being conflict-free, He maximizes *all* efforts and *all*
results. By teaching the power of the Kingdom of God Himself, He teaches
you that *all power is yours*. Its application does not matter. It is
*always* maximal. Your vigilance does not *establish* it as yours, but
it *does* enable you to use it *always* and in *all ways.*

<sup>25</sup> When I said, “I am with you always,” I meant it literally. I am not
absent to *anyone* in *any* situation. *Because* I am always with you,
*you* are the way and the truth and the light. You did not make this
power, any more than I did. It was created to *be* shared and therefore
cannot be meaningfully perceived as belonging to anyone *at the expense*
of another. Such a perception makes it meaningless by eliminating or
overlooking its *real* and *only* meaning.
