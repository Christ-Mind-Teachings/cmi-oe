The ultimate purpose of projection, as the ego uses it, is *always* to
get rid of guilt. Yet, characteristically, the ego attempts to get rid
of guilt from *its* viewpoint only, for much as the ego wants to retain
guilt, *you* find it intolerable, since guilt stands in the way of your
remembering God, Whose pull is so strong that you *cannot* resist it. On
this issue, then, the deepest split of all occurs, for if you are to
retain guilt as the ego insists, *you cannot be you*. Only by persuading
you that *it* is you, could the ego possibly induce you to project guilt
and thereby *keep* it in your mind.

<sup>2</sup> Yet consider how strange a solution the ego's arrangement is. You
project guilt to get rid of it, but you are actually merely concealing
it. You *do* experience guilt feelings, but you have no idea why. On the
contrary, you associate them with a weird assortment of ego ideals which
the ego claims you have failed. Yet you have no idea that you are
failing the Son of God by seeing him as guilty. Believing you are no
longer you, you do not realize that you are failing *yourself*.
