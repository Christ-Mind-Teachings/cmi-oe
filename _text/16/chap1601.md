To empathize does not mean to join in *suffering*, for that is what you
must *refuse* to understand. That is the *ego's* interpretation of
empathy and is always used to form a special relationship in which the
suffering is shared. The capacity to empathize is very useful to the
Holy Spirit, provided you let Him use it in His way. \[His way is very
different.\] He does not understand suffering and would have you teach
it is not *understandable*. When He relates through you, He does not
relate through the ego to another ego. He does not join in pain, knowing
that healing pain is not accomplished by delusional attempts to enter
into it and lighten it by sharing the delusion.

<sup>2</sup> The clearest proof that empathy as the ego uses it is destructive lies
in the fact that it is applied only to certain types of problems and in
certain people. These it selects *out* and joins *with*. And it never
joins except to strengthen *itself*. \[Having identified with what it
*thinks* it understands, it sees *itself* and would *increase* itself by
sharing what is *like* itself.\] Make no mistake about this maneuver;
the ego always empathizes to *weaken*, and to weaken is *always* to
attack. You do not know what empathizing means. Yet of this you may be
sure—if you will merely sit quietly by and let the Holy Spirit relate
through you, you will empathize with *strength* and *both* of you will
gain in strength, and not in weakness.

<sup>3</sup> Your part is only to remember this—you do not want anything *you*
value to come of the relationship. You will neither to hurt it nor to
heal it in your own way. You do not know what healing is. All you have
learned of empathy is from the *past*. And there is nothing from the
past that you would share, for there is nothing there that you would
*keep*. Do not use empathy to make the past real and so perpetuate it.
Step gently aside and let the healing be done *for* you. Keep but one
thought in mind and do not lose sight of it, however tempted you may be
to judge any situation and to determine your response *by* judging it.
Focus your mind only on this:

<sup>4</sup> *I am not alone, and I would not intrude the past upon my Guest.<br/>
I have invited Him, and He is here.<br/>
I need do nothing except **not to interfere** *.
