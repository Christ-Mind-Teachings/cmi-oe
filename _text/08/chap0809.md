<sup>80</sup> We once said that the Holy Spirit is the *Answer.* He is the Answer
to everything, because He knows what the answer to everything *is*. The
ego does not know what a real question is, although it asks an endless
number. Yet *you* can learn this as you learn to question the value of
the ego and thus establish your ability to evaluate its questions. When
the ego tempts you to sickness, do not ask the Holy Spirit to heal the
body, for this would merely be to accept the ego's belief that the
*body* is the proper aim for healing. Ask rather that the Holy Spirit
teach you the right *perception* of the *body*, for perception alone can
be distorted. *Only* perception can be sick, because only perception can
be *wrong*.

<sup>81</sup> Wrong perception is *distorted* *willing*, which wants things to be
as they are not. The *reality* of everything is totally harmless,
because total harmlessness is the *condition* of its reality. It is also
the condition of your *awareness* of its reality. You do not have to
seek reality. It will seek *you* and find you when you meet its
conditions. Its conditions are part of what it *is*. And this part only
is up to you. The rest is of itself. You need do so little, because it
is so powerful that your little part will bring the whole *to* you.
Accept then your little part, and *let* the whole be yours.

<sup>82</sup> Wholeness heals because it is of the mind. *All* forms of sickness,
even unto death, are physical expressions of the *fear of awakening*.
They are attempts to reinforce *unconsciousness* out of fear of
*consciousness.* This is a pathetic way of trying *not* to know by
rendering the faculties for knowing ineffectual. “Rest in peace” is a
blessing for the living, not the dead, because rest comes from *waking*,
not from sleeping. Sleep is withdrawing; waking is joining. Dreams are
*illusions* of joining, taking on the ego's distortions about what
joining means if you are sleeping under its guidance. Yet the Holy
Spirit, too, has use for sleep and can use dreams on behalf of *waking*
if you will let Him.

<sup>83</sup> How you wake is the sign of how you have used sleep. To whom did you
give it? Under which teacher did you place it? Whenever you wake
dispiritedly, it was *not* of the Holy Spirit. *Only* when you awaken
joyously have you utilized sleep according to the Holy Spirit's purpose.
You can indeed be “drugged by sleep,” but this is always because you
have *misused* it on behalf of sickness. Sleep is no more a form of
death than death is a form of unconsciousness. *Unconsciousness is
impossible.* You can rest in peace only *because* you are awake.

<sup>84</sup> Healing is release from the fear of waking and the substitution of
the *will to wake*. The will to wake is the will to love, since *all*
healing involves replacing fear with love. The Holy Spirit cannot
distinguish among degrees of error, for if He taught that one form of
sickness is more serious than another, He would be teaching that one
error can be *more real* than another. His function is to distinguish
*only* between the false and the true, *replacing* the false with the
true.

<sup>85</sup> The ego, which always *weakens* the will, wants to *separate* the
body from the mind. This is an attempt to *destroy* it, yet the ego
actually believes that it is *protecting* it. This is because the ego
believes that *mind is dangerous* and that to *make mindless* is to
heal. But to make mindless is impossible since it would mean to make
nothing out of what God created. The ego *despises* weakness, even
though it makes every effort to *induce* it. The ego *wants* only what
it hates. To the ego this is perfectly sensible. Believing in the power
of attack, the ego *wants* attack.

<sup>86</sup> You have surely begun to realize that this is a very practical course
which means *exactly* what it says. So does the Bible, if it is properly
understood. There has been a marked tendency on the part of many of the
Bible's followers and also its translators to be entirely literal about
fear and *its* effects but *not* about love and *its* results. Thus,
“hellfire” means “burning,” but raising the dead becomes allegorical.
Actually, it is *particularly* the references to the outcomes of love
which *should* be taken literally because the Bible is *about* love,
being about God.

<sup>87</sup> The Bible enjoins you to be perfect, to heal *all* errors, to take no
thought of the body *as separate*, and to accomplish all things in my
name. This is not my name alone, for ours is a shared identification.
The name of God's Son is one, and you are enjoined to do the works of
love, because we *share* this oneness. Our minds are whole *because*
they are one. If you are sick you are withdrawing from me. Yet you
cannot withdraw from me alone. You can only withdraw from yourself *and*
me.

<sup>88</sup> I would not ask you to do the things you cannot do, and it is
impossible that I could do things you cannot do. Given this, and given
this *quite* *literally*, there can be nothing which prevents you from
doing *exactly* what I ask, and everything which argues *for* your doing
it. I give you no limits because God lays none upon you. When you limit
*yourself*, we are *not* of one mind and that *is* sickness. Yet
sickness is not of the body, but of the *mind. All* forms of dysfunction
are merely signs that the mind has split and does not accept a unified
purpose.

<sup>89</sup> The unification of *purpose*, then, is the Holy Spirit's *only* way
of healing. This is because it is the only level at which healing means
anything. The re-establishing of meaning in a chaotic thought system
*is* the only way to heal it. We have said that your task is only to
meet the conditions *for* meaning since meaning itself is of God. Yet
your *return* to meaning is essential to *His* because your meaning is
*part* of His. Your healing, then, is part of *His* health since it is
part of His Wholeness. He cannot *lose* this, but *you* can not *know*
it. Yet it is still His Will for you, and His Will *must* stand forever
and in all things.
