<sup>56</sup> If you cannot hear the Voice of God, it is because you do not choose
to listen. The fact that you *do* listen to the voice of your ego is
demonstrated by your attitudes, your feelings, and your behavior. Your
attitudes are obviously conflicted, your feelings have a narrow range on
the negative side but are never purely joyous, and your behavior is
either strained or unpredictable. Yet this is what you *want*. This is
what you are fighting to keep and what you are vigilant to save. Your
minds are filled with schemes to save the face of your egos, and you do
not seek the Face of God. The glass in which the ego seeks to see its
face is dark indeed. How can it maintain the trick of its existence
except with mirrors? But where *you* look to find yourself is up to you.

<sup>57</sup> We have said that you cannot change your mind by changing your
behavior, but we have also said, and many times before, that you *can*
change your mind. When your mood tells you that you have chosen wrongly,
and this is so whenever you are not joyous, then *know* this need not
be. In every case you have thought wrongly about some Soul that God
created and are perceiving images your ego makes in a darkened glass.
Think honestly what you have thought that God would *not* have thought
and what you have *not* thought that God would have you think. Search
sincerely for what you have done and left undone accordingly, and then
change your minds *to think with God's*.

<sup>58</sup> This may seem hard to you, but it is much easier than trying to think
*against* it. Your mind *is* one with God's. Denying this and thinking
otherwise has held your ego together but has literally split your mind.
As a loving brother, I am deeply concerned with your mind and urge you
to follow my example as you look at yourselves and at each other and see
in both the glorious creations of a glorious Father.

<sup>59</sup> When you are sad, *know that this need not be*. Depression *always*
arises ultimately from a sense of being deprived of something you want
and do not have. *Know* you are deprived of nothing except by your own
decisions, and then decide otherwise.

<sup>60</sup> When you are anxious, *know* that all anxiety comes from the
capriciousness of the ego *and need not be*. You can be as vigilant
*against* the ego's dictates as *for* them.

<sup>61</sup> When you feel guilty, *know* that the ego has indeed violated the
laws of God, but *you* have not. Leave the sins of the ego to me. That
is what Atonement is for. But until you change your mind about those
your ego has hurt, the Atonement cannot release you. As long as you feel
guilty, your ego is in command because only the ego *can* experience
guilt. *This need not be*.

<sup>62</sup> Watch your mind for the temptations of the ego and do not be deceived
by it. *Know* it offers you nothing. When you have given up this
voluntary dispiriting, you will see how your mind can focus and rise
above fatigue and heal. Yet you are not sufficiently vigilant *against*
the demands of the ego to disengage yourself. *This need not be*.

<sup>63</sup> The habit of engaging *with* God and His creations is easily made if
you actively refuse to let your minds slip away. The problem is *not*
one of concentration; it is the belief that no one, including yourself,
is *worth* consistent effort. Side with me *consistently* against this
deception, and do not permit this shabby belief to pull you back. The
disheartened are useless to themselves and to me, but only the ego can
*be* disheartened. Have you *really* considered how many opportunities
you have to gladden yourselves and how many of them you have refused?
There is no limit to the power of a Son of God, but he himself can limit
the expression of his power as much as he chooses.

<sup>64</sup> Your mind and mine can unite in shining your ego away and releasing
the strength of God into everything you think and will and do. Do not
settle for anything *less* than this, and refuse to accept anything
*but* this as your goal. Watch your minds carefully for *any* beliefs
that hinder its accomplishment, and step away from them. Judge how well
you have done this by your own feelings, for this is the one *right* use
of judgment. Judgment, like any other defense, can be used to attack or
protect, to hurt or to heal. The ego *should* be brought to your
judgment and found wanting there. Without your own allegiance,
protection, and love, it cannot exist. Judge your ego truly, and you
*must* withdraw allegiance, protection, and love from it.

<sup>65</sup> You are mirrors of truth in which God Himself shines in perfect
light. To the ego's dark glass you need but say, “I will not look there
because I *know* these images are not true.” Then let the Holy One shine
on you in peace, knowing that this and *only* this must be. His Mind
shone on you in your creation and brought *your* mind into being. His
Mind still shines on you and must shine *through* you. Your ego cannot
prevent *Him* from shining on you, but it *can* prevent you from letting
Him shine *through* you.

<sup>66</sup> The first coming of Christ is just another name for the creation, for
Christ is the Son of God. The *second* coming of Christ means nothing
more than the end of the ego's rule over part of the minds of men and
the healing of the mind. I was created like you in the first, and I have
called you to join with me in the second. If you will think over your
lives, you will see how carefully the preparations were made. I am in
charge of the second coming, and my judgment, which is used only for
protection, cannot be wrong because it *never* attacks. *Yours* is so
distorted that you believe I was mistaken in choosing you. I assure you
this is a mistake of your egos. Do *not* mistake it for humility.

<sup>67</sup> Your egos are trying to convince you that *they* are real and *I* am
not because, if *I* am real, I am no more real than *you* are. That
knowledge, and I assure you that it *is* knowledge, means that Christ
must come into your minds and heal them. Although I am *not* attacking
your egos, I *am* working with your higher mind whether you are asleep
or awake, just as your ego does with your lower mind. I am your
vigilance in this, because you are too confused to recognize your own
hope. I was *not* mistaken. Your minds *will* elect to join with mine,
and together we are invincible.

<sup>68</sup> You will yet come together in my name, and your sanity will be
restored. I raised the dead by *knowing* that life is an eternal
attribute of everything that the living God created. Why do you believe
it is harder for me to inspire the dispirited or to stabilize the
unstable? *I* do not believe that there is an order of difficulty in
miracles; *you* do. I have called, and you will answer. I *know* that
miracles are natural because they are expressions of love. My calling
you is as natural as your answer and as inevitable.
